Ada (programming language)

Ada is a structured, statically typed,
imperative, and object-oriented
high-level programming language,
inspired by Pascal and other languages.
It has built-in language support for
design by contract (DbC), extremely
strong typing, explicit concurrency,
tasks, synchronous message passing,
protected objects, and non-determinism.
Ada improves code safety and
maintainability by using the compiler
to find errors in favor of runtime
errors. Ada is an international
technical standard, jointly defined by
the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), and the
International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC). As of May 2023, the
standard, ISO/IEC 8652:2023, is called
Ada 2022 informally.
