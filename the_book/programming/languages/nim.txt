Nim (programming language)

Nim is a general-purpose,
multi-paradigm, statically typed,
compiled high-level system programming
language, designed and developed by a
team around Andreas Rumpf. Nim is
designed to be "efficient, expressive,
and elegant", supporting
metaprogramming, functional, message
passing, procedural, and
object-oriented programming styles by
providing several features such as
compile time code generation, algebraic
data types, a foreign function
interface (FFI) with C, C++,
Objective-C, and JavaScript, and
supporting compiling to those same
languages as intermediate
representations.
