**BASIC**

BASIC is a family of general-purpose,
high-level programming languages
designed for ease of use. The original
version was created by John G. Kemeny
and Thomas E. Kurtz at Dartmouth
College in 1964. They wanted to enable
students in non-scientific fields to
use computers. At the time, nearly all
computers required writing custom
software, which only scientists and
mathematicians tended to learn.
