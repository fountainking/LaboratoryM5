Lua

Lua is a lightweight, high-level,
multi-paradigm programming language
designed mainly for embedded use in
applications. Lua is cross-platform
software, since the interpreter of
compiled bytecode is written in ANSI C,
and Lua has a relatively simple C
application programming interface (API)
to embed it into applications.
