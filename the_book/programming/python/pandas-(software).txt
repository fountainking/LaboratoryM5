Pandas (software)

Pandas is a software library written
for the Python programming language for
data manipulation and analysis. In
particular, it offers data structures
and operations for manipulating
numerical tables and time series. It is
free software released under the
three-clause BSD license. The name is
derived from the term "panel data", an
econometrics term for data sets that
include observations over multiple time
periods for the same individuals, as
well as a play on the phrase "Python
data analysis". Wes McKinney started
building what would become Pandas at
AQR Capital while he was a researcher
there from 2007 to 2010.
