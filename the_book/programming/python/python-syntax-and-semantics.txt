Python syntax and semantics

The syntax of the Python programming
language is the set of rules that
defines how a Python program will be
written and interpreted. The Python
language has many similarities to Perl,
C, and Java. However, there are some
definite differences between the
languages. It supports multiple
programming paradigms, including
structured, object-oriented
programming, and functional
programming, and boasts a dynamic type
system and automatic memory management.
