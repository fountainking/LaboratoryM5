Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a plotting library for
the Python programming language and its
numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
It provides an object-oriented API for
embedding plots into applications using
general-purpose GUI toolkits like
Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK. There is
also a procedural "pylab" interface
based on a state machine, designed to
closely resemble that of MATLAB, though
its use is discouraged. SciPy makes use
of Matplotlib.
