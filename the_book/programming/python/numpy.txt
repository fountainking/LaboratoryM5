NumPy

NumPy is a library for the Python
programming language, adding support
for large, multi-dimensional arrays and
matrices, along with a large collection
of high-level mathematical functions to
operate on these arrays. The
predecessor of NumPy, Numeric, was
originally created by Jim Hugunin with
contributions from several other
developers. In 2005, Travis Oliphant
created NumPy by incorporating features
of the competing Numarray into Numeric,
with extensive modifications. NumPy is
open-source software and has many
contributors. NumPy is fiscally
sponsored by NumFOCUS.
