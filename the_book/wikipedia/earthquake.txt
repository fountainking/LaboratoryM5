**EARTHQUAKE**

Earthquake

An earthquake, also called a quake,
tremor, or temblor, is the shaking of
the Earth's surface resulting from a
sudden release of energy in the
lithosphere that creates seismic waves.
Earthquakes can range in intensity,
from those so weak they cannot be felt,
to those violent enough to propel
objects and people into the air, damage
critical infrastructure, and wreak
destruction across entire cities. The
seismic activity of an area is the
frequency, type, and size of
earthquakes experienced over a
particular time. The seismicity at a
particular location in the Earth is the
average rate of seismic energy release
per unit volume.
