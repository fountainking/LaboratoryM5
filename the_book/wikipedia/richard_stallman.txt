Richard Stallman

Richard Matthew Stallman, also known by
his initials, rms, is an American free
software movement activist and
programmer. He campaigns for software
to be distributed in such a manner that
its users have the freedom to use,
study, distribute, and modify that
software. Software which ensures these
freedoms is termed free software.
Stallman launched the GNU Project,
founded the Free Software Foundation
(FSF) in October 1985, developed the
GNU Compiler Collection and GNU Emacs,
and wrote all versions of the GNU
General Public License.
