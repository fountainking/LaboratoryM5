Gastrointestinal tract

The gastrointestinal tract is the tract
or passageway of the digestive system
that leads from the mouth to the anus.
The tract is one of the largest of the
body's systems. The GI tract contains
all the major organs of the digestive
system, in humans and other animals,
including the esophagus, stomach, and
intestines. Food taken in through the
mouth is digested to extract nutrients
and absorb energy, and the waste
expelled at the anus as feces.
Gastrointestinal is an adjective
meaning of or pertaining to the stomach
and intestines.
