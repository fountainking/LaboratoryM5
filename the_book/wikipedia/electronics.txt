Electronics

Electronics is a scientific and
engineering discipline that studies and
applies the principles of physics to
design, create, and operate devices
that manipulate electrons and other
electrically charged particles. It is a
subfield of physics and electrical
engineering which uses active devices
such as transistors, diodes, and
integrated circuits to control and
amplify the flow of electric current
and to convert it from one form to
another, such as from alternating
current (AC) to direct current (DC) or
from analog signals to digital signals.
Electronics is often contrasted with
electrical power engineering, which
focuses on generation, transmission,
and distribution of electric power
rather than signal processing or device
level control.
