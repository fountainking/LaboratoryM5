Velocity

Velocity is a measurement of speed in a
certain direction of motion. It is a
fundamental concept in kinematics, the
branch of classical mechanics that
describes the motion of physical
objects. Velocity is a vector quantity,
meaning that both magnitude and
direction are needed to define it. The
scalar absolute value (magnitude) of
velocity is called speed, a quantity
that is measured in metres per second
in the SI (metric) system. For example,
"5 metres per second" is a scalar,
whereas "5 metres per second east" is a
vector. If there is a change in speed,
direction or both, then the object is
said to be undergoing an acceleration.
