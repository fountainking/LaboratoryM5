also known as Ada Lovelace, was an
English mathematician and writer
chiefly known for her work on Charles

general-purpose computer, the
Analytical Engine. She was the first to
recognise that the machine had
applications beyond pure calculation.
Ada Lovelace is sometimes considered to
be the first computer programmer.
