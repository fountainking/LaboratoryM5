Kidney

In humans, the kidneys are two
reddish-brown bean-shaped
blood-filtering organs that are a
multilobar, multipapillary form of
mammalian kidneys, usually without
signs of external lobulation. They are
located on the left and right in the
retroperitoneal space, and in adult
humans are about 12 centimetres in
length. They receive blood from the
paired renal arteries; blood exits into
the paired renal veins. Each kidney is
attached to a ureter, a tube that
carries excreted urine to the bladder.
