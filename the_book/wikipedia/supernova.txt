**SUPERNOVA**

Supernova

A supernova is a powerful and luminous
explosion of a star. A supernova occurs
during the last evolutionary stages of
a massive star, or when a white dwarf
is triggered into runaway nuclear
fusion. The original object, called the
progenitor, either collapses to a
neutron star or black hole, or is
completely destroyed to form a diffuse
nebula. The peak optical luminosity of
a supernova can be comparable to that
of an entire galaxy before fading over
several weeks or months.
