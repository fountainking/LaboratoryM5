Evolution

Evolution is the change in the
heritable characteristics of biological
populations over successive
generations. It occurs when
evolutionary processes such as genetic
drift and natural selection act on
genetic variation, resulting in certain
characteristics becoming more or less
common within a population over
successive generations. The process of
evolution has given rise to
biodiversity at every level of
biological organisation.
