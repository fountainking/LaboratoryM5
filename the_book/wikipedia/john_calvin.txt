John Calvin

John Calvin was a French theologian,
pastor and reformer in Geneva during
the Protestant Reformation. He was a
principal figure in the development of
the system of Christian theology later
called Calvinism, including its
doctrines of predestination and of
God's absolute sovereignty in the
salvation of the human soul from death
and eternal damnation. Calvinist
doctrines were influenced by and
elaborated upon Augustinian and other
Christian traditions. Various Reformed
Church movements, including Continental
Reformed, Congregationalism,
Presbyterianism, Waldensians, Baptist
Reformed, Calvinist Methodism, and
Reformed Anglican Churches, which look
to Calvin as the chief expositor of
their beliefs, have spread throughout
the world.
