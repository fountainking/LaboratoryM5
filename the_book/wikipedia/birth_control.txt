Birth control

Birth control, also known as
contraception, anticonception, and
fertility control, is the use of
methods or devices to prevent
pregnancy. Birth control has been used
since ancient times, but effective and
safe methods of birth control only
became available in the 20th century.
Planning, making available, and using
human birth control is called family
planning. Some cultures limit or
discourage access to birth control
because they consider it to be morally,
religiously, or politically
undesirable.
