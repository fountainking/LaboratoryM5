Hard disk drive

A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk,
hard drive, or fixed disk is an
electro-mechanical data storage device
that stores and retrieves digital data
using magnetic storage with one or more
rigid rapidly rotating platters coated
with magnetic material. The platters
are paired with magnetic heads, usually
arranged on a moving actuator arm,
which read and write data to the
platter surfaces. Data is accessed in a
random-access manner, meaning that
individual blocks of data can be stored
and retrieved in any order. HDDs are a
type of non-volatile storage, retaining
stored data when powered off. Modern
HDDs are typically in the form of a
small rectangular box, possibly in a
disk enclosure for portability.
