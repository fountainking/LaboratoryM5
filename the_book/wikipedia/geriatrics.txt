Geriatrics

Geriatrics, or geriatric medicine, is a
medical specialty focused on addressing
the unique health needs of older
adults. The term geriatrics originates
from the Greek geron meaning "old man",
and iatros meaning "healer". It aims to
promote health by preventing,
diagnosing and treating disease in
older adults. Older adults may be
healthy, but they're more likely to
have chronic health concerns and
require more medical care. There is not
a defined age at which patients may be
under the care of a geriatrician, or
geriatric physician, a physician who
specializes in the care of older
people. Rather, this decision is guided
by individual patient needs and the
caregiving structures available to
them. This care may benefit those who
are managing multiple chronic
conditions or experiencing significant
age-related complications that threaten
quality of daily life. Geriatric care
may be indicated if caregiving
responsibilities become increasingly
stressful or medically complex for
family and caregivers to manage
independently.
