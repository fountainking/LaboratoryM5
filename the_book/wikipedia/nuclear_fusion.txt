**NUCLEAR FUSION**

---------------------------------------

Nuclear fusion

Nuclear fusion is a reaction in which
two or more atomic nuclei combine to
form a larger nucleus. The difference
in mass between the reactants and
products is manifested as either the
release or absorption of energy. This
difference in mass arises as a result
of the difference in nuclear binding
energy between the atomic nuclei before
and after the fusion reaction. Nuclear
fusion is the process that powers all
active stars, via many reaction
pathways.
