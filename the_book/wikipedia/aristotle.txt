Aristotle

Aristotle was an ancient Greek
philosopher and polymath. His writings
cover a broad range of subjects
spanning the natural sciences,
philosophy, linguistics, economics,
politics, psychology, and the arts. As
the founder of the Peripatetic school
of philosophy in the Lyceum in Athens,
he began the wider Aristotelian
tradition that followed, which set the
groundwork for the development of
modern science.
