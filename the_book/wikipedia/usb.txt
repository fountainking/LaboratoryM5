USB

Universal Serial Bus (USB) is an
industry standard, developed by USB
Implementers Forum (USB-IF), for
digital data transmission and power
delivery between many types of
electronics. It specifies the
architecture, in particular the
physical interfaces, and communication
protocols to and from hosts, such as
personal computers, to and from
peripheral devices, e.g. displays,
keyboards, and mass storage devices,
and to and from intermediate hubs,
which multiply the number of a host's
ports.
