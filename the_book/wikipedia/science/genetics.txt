Genetics

Genetics is the study of genes, genetic
variation, and heredity in organisms.
It is an important branch in biology
because heredity is vital to organisms'
evolution. Gregor Mendel, a Moravian
Augustinian friar working in the 19th
century in Brno, was the first to study
genetics scientifically. Mendel studied
"trait inheritance", patterns in the
way traits are handed down from parents
to offspring over time. He observed
that organisms inherit traits by way of
discrete "units of inheritance". This
term, still used today, is a somewhat
ambiguous definition of what is
referred to as a gene.
