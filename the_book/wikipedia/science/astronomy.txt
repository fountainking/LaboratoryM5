Astronomy

Astronomy is a natural science that
studies celestial objects and the
phenomena that occur in the cosmos. It
uses mathematics, physics, and
chemistry to explain their origin and
their overall evolution. Objects of
interest include planets, moons, stars,
nebulae, galaxies, meteoroids,
asteroids, and comets. Relevant
phenomena include supernova explosions,
gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars,
pulsars, and cosmic microwave
background radiation. More generally,
astronomy studies everything that
originates beyond Earth's atmosphere.
Cosmology is the branch of astronomy
that studies the universe as a whole.
