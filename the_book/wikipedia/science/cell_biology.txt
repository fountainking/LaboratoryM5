Cell (biology)

The cell is the basic structural and
functional unit of all forms of life or
organisms. The term comes from the
Latin word cellula meaning 'small
room'. A biological cell basically
consists of a semipermeable cell
membrane enclosing cytoplasm that
contains genetic material. Most cells
are only visible under a microscope.
Except for highly-differentiated cell
types most cells are capable of
replication, and protein synthesis.
Some types of cell are motile. Cells
emerged on Earth about four billion
years ago.
