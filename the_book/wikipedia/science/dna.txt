DNA

Deoxyribonucleic acid is a polymer
composed of two polynucleotide chains
that coil around each other to form a
double helix. The polymer carries
genetic instructions for the
development, functioning, growth and
reproduction of all known organisms and
many viruses. DNA and ribonucleic acid
(RNA) are nucleic acids. Alongside
proteins, lipids and complex
carbohydrates (polysaccharides),
nucleic acids are one of the four major
types of macromolecules that are
essential for all known forms of life.
