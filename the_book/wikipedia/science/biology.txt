Biology

Biology is the scientific study of life
and living organisms. It is a broad
natural science that encompasses a wide
range of fields and unifying principles
that explain the structure, function,
growth, origin, evolution, and
distribution of life. Central to
biology are five fundamental themes:
the cell as the basic unit of life,
genes and heredity as the basis of
inheritance, evolution as the driver of
biological diversity, energy
transformation for sustaining life
processes, and the maintenance of
internal stability (homeostasis).
