**COBOL**

COBOL is a compiled English-like
computer programming language designed
for business use. It is an imperative,
procedural, and, since 2002,
object-oriented language. COBOL is
primarily used in business, finance,
and administrative systems for
companies and governments. COBOL is
still widely used in applications
deployed on mainframe computers, such
as large-scale batch and transaction
processing jobs. Many large financial
institutions were developing new
systems in the language as late as
2006, but most programming in COBOL
today is purely to maintain existing
applications. Programs are being moved
to new platforms, rewritten in modern
languages, or replaced with other
software.
