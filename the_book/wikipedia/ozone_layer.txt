Ozone layer

The ozone layer or ozone shield is a
region of Earth's stratosphere that
absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet
radiation. It contains a high
concentration of ozone (O3) in relation
to other parts of the atmosphere,
although still small in relation to
other gases in the stratosphere. The
ozone layer peaks at 8 to 15 parts per
million of ozone, while the average
ozone concentration in Earth's
atmosphere as a whole is about 0.3
parts per million. The ozone layer is
mainly found in the lower portion of
the stratosphere, from approximately 15
to 35 kilometers (9 to 22mi) above
Earth, although its thickness varies
seasonally and geographically.
