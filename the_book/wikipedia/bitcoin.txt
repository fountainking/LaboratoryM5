Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the first decentralized
cryptocurrency. Based on a free-market
ideology, bitcoin was invented in 2008
when an unknown entity published a
white paper under the pseudonym of
Satoshi Nakamoto. Use of bitcoin as a
currency began in 2009, with the
release of its open-source
implementation. From 2021 until 2025,
El Salvador adopted it as legal tender
currency. As bitcoin is pseudonymous,
its use by criminals has attracted the
attention of regulators, leading to its
ban by several countries as of 2021.
