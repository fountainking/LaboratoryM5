Integrated circuit

An integrated circuit (IC), also known
as a microchip or simply chip, is a
compact assembly of electronic circuits
formed from various electronic
components such as transistors,
resistors, and capacitors and their
interconnections. These components are
fabricated onto a thin, flat piece
("chip") of semiconductor material,
most commonly silicon. Integrated
circuits are integral to a wide variety
of electronic devices including
computers, smartphones, and televisions
performing functions such as data
processing, control, and storage. They
have transformed the field of
electronics by enabling device
miniaturization, improving performance,
and reducing cost.
