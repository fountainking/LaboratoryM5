Organ transplantation

Organ transplantation is a medical
procedure in which an organ is removed
from one body and placed in the body of
a recipient, to replace a damaged or
missing organ. The donor and recipient
may be at the same location, or organs
may be transported from a donor site to
another location. Organs and/or tissues
that are transplanted within the same
person's body are called autografts.
Transplants that are recently performed
between two subjects of the same
species are called allografts.
Allografts can either be from a living
or cadaveric source.
