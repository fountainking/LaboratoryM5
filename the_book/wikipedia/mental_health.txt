Mental health

Mental health encompasses emotional,
psychological, and social well-being,
influencing cognition, perception, and
behavior. Mental health plays a crucial
role in an individual's daily life when
managing stress, engaging with others,
and contributing to life overall.
According to the World Health
Organization (WHO), it is a "state of
well-being in which the individual
realizes that their abilities, can cope
with the normal stresses of life, can
work productively and fruitfully, and
can contribute to their community". It
likewise determines how an individual
handles stress, interpersonal
relationships, and decision-making.
Mental health includes subjective
well-being, perceived self-efficacy,
autonomy, competence, intergenerational
dependence, and self-actualization of
one's intellectual and emotional
potential, among others.
