Acceleration

In mechanics, acceleration is the rate
of change of the velocity of an object
with respect to time. Acceleration is
one of several components of
kinematics, the study of motion.
Accelerations are vector quantities.
The orientation of an object's
acceleration is given by the
orientation of the net force acting on
that object. The magnitude of an
object's acceleration, as described by
Newton's second law, is the combined
effect of two causes:the net balance of
all external forces acting onto that
object magnitude is directly
proportional to this net resulting
force; that object's mass, depending on
the materials out of which it is made
magnitude is inversely proportional to
the object's mass.
