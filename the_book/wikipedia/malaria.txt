Malaria

Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious
disease that affects vertebrates and
Anopheles mosquitoes. Human malaria
causes symptoms that typically include
fever, fatigue, vomiting, and
headaches. In severe cases, it can
cause jaundice, seizures, coma, or
death. Symptoms usually begin 10 to 15
days after being bitten by an infected
Anopheles mosquito. If not properly
treated, people may have recurrences of
the disease months later. In those who
have recently survived an infection,
reinfection usually causes milder
symptoms. This partial resistance
disappears over months to years if the
person has no continuing exposure to
malaria. The mosquitoes themselves are
harmed by malaria, causing reduced
lifespans in those infected by it.
