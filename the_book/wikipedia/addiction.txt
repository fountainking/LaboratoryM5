Addiction

Addiction is a neuropsychological
disorder characterized by a persistent
and intense urge to use a drug or
engage in a behavior that produces
natural reward, despite substantial
harm and other negative consequences.
Repetitive drug use can alter brain
function in synapses similar to natural
rewards like food or falling in love in
ways that perpetuate craving and
weakens self-control for people with
pre-existing vulnerabilities. This
phenomenon drugs reshaping brain
function has led to an understanding of
addiction as a brain disorder with a
complex variety of psychosocial as well
as neurobiological factors that are
implicated in the development of
addiction. While mice given cocaine
showed the compulsive and involuntary
nature of addiction, for humans this is
more complex, related to behavior or
personality traits.
