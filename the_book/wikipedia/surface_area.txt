Surface area

The surface area of a solid object is a
measure of the total area that the
surface of the object occupies. The
mathematical definition of surface area
in the presence of curved surfaces is
considerably more involved than the
definition of arc length of
one-dimensional curves, or of the
surface area for polyhedra, for which
the surface area is the sum of the
areas of its faces. Smooth surfaces,
such as a sphere, are assigned surface
area using their representation as
parametric surfaces. This definition of
surface area is based on methods of
infinitesimal calculus and involves
partial derivatives and double
integration.
