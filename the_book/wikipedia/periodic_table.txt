Periodic table

The periodic table, also known as the
periodic table of the elements, is an
ordered arrangement of the chemical
elements into rows ("periods") and
columns ("groups"). An icon of
chemistry, the periodic table is widely
used in physics and other sciences. It
is a depiction of the periodic law,
which states that when the elements are
arranged in order of their atomic
numbers an approximate recurrence of
their properties is evident. The table
is divided into four roughly
rectangular areas called blocks.
Elements in the same group tend to show
similar chemical characteristics.
