Jet engine

A jet engine is a type of reaction
engine, discharging a fast-moving jet
of heated gas that generates thrust by
jet propulsion. While this broad
definition may include rocket, water
jet, and hybrid propulsion, the term
jet engine typically refers to an
internal combustion air-breathing jet
engine such as a turbojet, turbofan,
ramjet, pulse jet, or scramjet. In
general, jet engines are internal
combustion engines.
