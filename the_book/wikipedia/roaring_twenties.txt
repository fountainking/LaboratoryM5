Roaring Twenties

The Roaring Twenties, sometimes
stylized as Roaring '20s, refers to the
1920s decade in music and fashion, as
it happened in Western society and
Western culture. It was a period of
economic prosperity with a distinctive
cultural edge in the United States and
internationally, particularly in major
cities such as Berlin, Buenos Aires,
Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Mexico
City, New York City, Paris, and Sydney.
In France, the decade was known as the
annes folles, emphasizing the era's
social, artistic and cultural dynamism.
Jazz blossomed, the flapper redefined
the modern look for British and
American women, and Art Deco peaked.
