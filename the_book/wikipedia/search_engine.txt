Search engine

A search engine is a software system
that provides hyperlinks to web pages,
and other relevant information on the
Web in response to a user's query. The
user enters a query in a web browser or
a mobile app, and the search results
are typically presented as a list of
hyperlinks accompanied by textual
summaries and images. Users also have
the option of limiting a search to
specific types of results, such as
images, videos, or news.
