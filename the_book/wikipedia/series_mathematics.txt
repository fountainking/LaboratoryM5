Series (mathematics)

In mathematics, a series is, roughly
speaking, an addition of infinitely
many terms, one after the other. The
study of series is a major part of
calculus and its generalization,
mathematical analysis. Series are used
in most areas of mathematics, even for
studying finite structures in
combinatorics through generating
functions. The mathematical properties
of infinite series make them widely
applicable in other quantitative
disciplines such as physics, computer
science, statistics and finance.
