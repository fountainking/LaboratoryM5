Leonardo da Vinci

Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci was an
Italian polymath of the High
Renaissance who was active as a
painter, draughtsman, engineer,
scientist, theorist, sculptor, and
architect. While his fame initially
rested on his achievements as a
painter, he has also become known for
his notebooks, in which he made
drawings and notes on a variety of
subjects, including anatomy, astronomy,
botany, cartography, painting, and
palaeontology. Leonardo is widely
regarded to have been a genius who
epitomised the Renaissance humanist
ideal, and his collective works
comprise a contribution to later
generations of artists matched only by
that of his younger contemporary
Michelangelo.
