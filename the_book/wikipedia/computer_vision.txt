Computer vision

Computer vision tasks include methods
for acquiring, processing, analyzing,
and understanding digital images, and
extraction of high-dimensional data
from the real world in order to produce
numerical or symbolic information, e.g.
in the form of decisions.
"Understanding" in this context
signifies the transformation of visual
images into descriptions of the world
that make sense to thought processes
and can elicit appropriate action. This
image understanding can be seen as the
disentangling of symbolic information
from image data using models
constructed with the aid of geometry,
physics, statistics, and learning
theory.
