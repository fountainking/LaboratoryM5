Integral

In mathematics, an integral is the
continuous analog of a sum, which is
used to calculate areas, volumes, and
their generalizations. Integration, the
process of computing an integral, is
one of the two fundamental operations
of calculus, the other being
differentiation. Integration was
initially used to solve problems in
mathematics and physics, such as
finding the area under a curve, or
determining displacement from velocity.
Usage of integration expanded to a wide
variety of scientific fields
thereafter.
