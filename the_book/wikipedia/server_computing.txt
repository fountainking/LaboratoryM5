Server (computing)

A server is a computer that provides
information to other computers called
"clients" on a computer network. This
architecture is called the clientserver
model. Servers can provide various
functionalities, often called
"services", such as sharing data or
resources among multiple clients or
performing computations for a client. A
single server can serve multiple
clients, and a single client can use
multiple servers. A client process may
run on the same device or may connect
over a network to a server on a
different device. Typical servers are
database servers, file servers, mail
servers, print servers, web servers,
game servers, and application servers.
