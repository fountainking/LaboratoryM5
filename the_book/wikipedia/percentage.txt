Percentage

In mathematics, a percentage, percent,
or per cent is a number or ratio
expressed as a fraction of 100. It is
often denoted using the percent sign

pct, and sometimes pc are also used. A
percentage is a dimensionless number,
primarily used for expressing
proportions, but percent is nonetheless
a unit of measurement in its
orthography and usage.
