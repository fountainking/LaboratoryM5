Cleopatra

Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator was Queen
of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from
51 to 30BC, and the last active
Hellenistic pharaoh. A member of the
Ptolemaic dynasty, she was a descendant
of its founder Ptolemy I Soter, a
Macedonian Greek general and companion
of Alexander the Great. Her first
language was Koine Greek, and she is
the only Ptolemaic ruler known to have
learned the Egyptian language, among
several others. After her death, Egypt
became a province of the Roman Empire,
marking the end of the Hellenistic
period in the Mediterranean, which had
begun during the reign of Alexander.
