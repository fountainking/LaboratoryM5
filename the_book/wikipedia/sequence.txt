Sequence

In mathematics, a sequence is an
enumerated collection of objects in
which repetitions are allowed and order
matters. Like a set, it contains
members. The number of elements is
called the length of the sequence.
Unlike a set, the same elements can
appear multiple times at different
positions in a sequence, and unlike a
set, the order does matter. Formally, a
sequence can be defined as a function
from natural numbers to the elements at
each position. The notion of a sequence
can be generalized to an indexed
family, defined as a function from an
arbitrary index set.
