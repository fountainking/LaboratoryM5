Sleep

Sleep is a state of reduced mental and
physical activity in which
consciousness is altered and certain
sensory activity is inhibited. During
sleep, there is a marked decrease in
muscle activity and interactions with
the surrounding environment. While
sleep differs from wakefulness in terms
of the ability to react to stimuli, it
still involves active brain patterns,
making it more reactive than a coma or
disorders of consciousness.
