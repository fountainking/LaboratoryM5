Island

An island or isle is a piece of land,
distinct from a continent, completely
surrounded by water. There are
continental islands, which were formed
by being split from a continent by
plate tectonics, and oceanic islands,
which have never been part of a
continent. Oceanic islands can be
formed from volcanic activity, grow
into atolls from coral reefs, and form
from sediment along shorelines,
creating barrier islands. River islands
can also form from sediment and debris
in rivers. Artificial islands are those
made by humans, including small rocky
outcroppings built out of lagoons and
large-scale land reclamation projects
used for development.
