Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a prolific
and influential composer of the
Classical period. Despite his short
life, his rapid pace of composition and
proficiency from an early age resulted
in more than 800 works representing
virtually every Western classical genre
of his time. Many of these compositions
are acknowledged as pinnacles of the
symphonic, concertante, chamber,
operatic, and choral repertoires.
Mozart is widely regarded as one of the
greatest composers in the history of
Western music, with his music admired
for its "melodic beauty, its formal
elegance and its richness of harmony
and texture".
