Computer

A computer is a machine that can be
programmed to automatically carry out
sequences of arithmetic or logical
operations (computation). Modern
digital electronic computers can
perform generic sets of operations
known as programs, which enable
computers to perform a wide range of
tasks. The term computer system may
refer to a nominally complete computer
that includes the hardware, operating
system, software, and peripheral
equipment needed and used for full
operation; or to a group of computers
that are linked and function together,
such as a computer network or computer
cluster.
