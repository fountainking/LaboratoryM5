Satellite

A satellite or an artificial satellite
is an object, typically a spacecraft,
placed into orbit around a celestial
body. They have a variety of uses,
including communication relay, weather
forecasting, navigation (GPS),
broadcasting, scientific research, and
Earth observation. Additional military
uses are reconnaissance, early warning,
signals intelligence and, potentially,
weapon delivery. Other satellites
include the final rocket stages that
place satellites in orbit and formerly
useful satellites that later become
defunct.
