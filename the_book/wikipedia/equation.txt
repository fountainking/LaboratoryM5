Equation

In mathematics, an equation is a
mathematical formula that expresses the
equality of two expressions, by
connecting them with the equals sign =.
The word equation and its cognates in
other languages may have subtly
different meanings; for example, in
French an quation is defined as
containing one or more variables, while
in English, any well-formed formula
consisting of two expressions related
with an equals sign is an equation.
