Turbine

A turbine is a rotary mechanical device
that extracts energy from a fluid flow
and converts it into useful work. The
work produced can be used for
generating electrical power when
combined with a generator. A turbine is
a turbomachine with at least one moving
part called a rotor assembly, which is
a shaft or drum with blades attached.
Moving fluid acts on the blades so that
they move and impart rotational energy
to the rotor.
