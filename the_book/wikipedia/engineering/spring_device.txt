Spring (device)

A spring is a device consisting of an
elastic but largely rigid material bent
or molded into a form that can return
into shape after being compressed or
extended. Springs can store energy when
compressed. In everyday use, the term
most often refers to coil springs, but
there are many different spring
designs. Modern springs are typically
manufactured from spring steel. An
example of a non-metallic spring is the
bow, made traditionally of flexible yew
wood, which when drawn stores energy to
propel an arrow.
