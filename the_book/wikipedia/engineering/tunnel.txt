**TUNNEL**

---------------------------------------

Tunnel

A tunnel is an underground or undersea
passageway. It is dug through
surrounding soil, earth or rock, or
laid under water, and is usually
completely enclosed except for the two
portals common at each end, though
there may be access and ventilation
openings at various points along the
length. A pipeline differs
significantly from a tunnel, though
some recent tunnels have used immersed
tube construction techniques rather
than traditional tunnel boring methods.
