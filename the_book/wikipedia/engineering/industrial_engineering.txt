Industrial engineering

Industrial engineering (IE) is
concerned with the design, improvement
and installation of integrated systems
of people, materials, information,
equipment and energy. It draws upon
specialized knowledge and skill in the
mathematical, physical, and social
sciences together with the principles
and methods of engineering analysis and
design, to specify, predict, and
evaluate the results to be obtained
from such systems. Industrial
engineering is a branch of engineering
that focuses on optimizing complex
processes, systems, and organizations
by improving efficiency, productivity,
and quality. It combines principles
from engineering, mathematics, and
business to design, analyze, and manage
systems that involve people, materials,
information, equipment, and energy.
Industrial engineers aim to reduce
waste, streamline operations, and
enhance overall performance across
various industries, including
manufacturing, healthcare, logistics,
and service sectors.
