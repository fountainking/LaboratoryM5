Propeller

A propeller is a device with a rotating
hub and radiating blades that are set
at a pitch to form a helical spiral
which, when rotated, exerts linear
thrust upon a working fluid such as
water or air. Propellers are used to
pump fluid through a pipe or duct, or
to create thrust to propel a boat
through water or an aircraft through
air.
