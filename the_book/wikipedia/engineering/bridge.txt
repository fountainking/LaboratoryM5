Bridge

A bridge is a structure built to span
physical obstacles such as rivers,
lakes, roads, railways, ravines, or
other geographic or artificial
barriers. Its primary purpose is to
provide passage over the obstacle,
facilitating the movement of
automobiles, trains, and pedestrians,
but it may also accommodate pipelines,
utility lines, buildings, wildlife
crossings, and even canals.
