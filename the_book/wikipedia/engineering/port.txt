**PORT**

---------------------------------------

Port

A port is a maritime facility
comprising one or more wharves or
loading areas, where ships load and
discharge cargo and passengers.
Although usually situated on a sea
coast or estuary, ports can also be
found far inland, such as Hamburg,
Manchester and Duluth; these access the
sea via rivers or canals. Because of
their roles as ports of entry for
immigrants as well as soldiers in
wartime, many port cities have
experienced dramatic multi-ethnic and
multicultural changes throughout their
histories.
