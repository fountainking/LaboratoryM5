Transformer

In electrical engineering, a
transformer is a passive component that
transfers electrical energy from one
electrical circuit to another circuit,
or multiple circuits. A varying current
in any coil of the transformer produces
a varying magnetic flux in the
transformer's core, which induces a
varying electromotive force (EMF)
across any other coils wound around the
same core. Electrical energy can be
transferred between separate coils
without a metallic (conductive)
connection between the two circuits.
Faraday's law of induction, discovered
in 1831, describes the induced voltage
effect in any coil due to a changing
magnetic flux encircled by the coil.
