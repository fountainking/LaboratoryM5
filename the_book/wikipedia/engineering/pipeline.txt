Pipeline

A pipeline is a system of pipes for
long-distance transportation of a
liquid or gas, typically to a market
area for consumption. Data from 2014
give a total of slightly less than
2.175 million miles of pipeline in 120
countries around the world. The United
States had 65%, Russia had 8%, and
Canada had 3%, thus 76% of all pipeline
were in these three countries. The main
attribute to pollution from pipelines
is caused by corrosion and leakage.
