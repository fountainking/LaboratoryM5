Dam

A dam is a barrier that stops or
restricts the flow of surface water or
underground streams. Reservoirs created
by dams not only suppress floods but
also provide water for activities such
as irrigation, human consumption,
industrial use, aquaculture, and
navigability. Hydropower is often used
in conjunction with dams to generate
electricity. A dam can also be used to
collect or store water which can be
evenly distributed between locations.
Dams generally serve the primary
purpose of retaining water, while other
structures such as floodgates or levees
are used to manage or prevent water
flow into specific land regions.
