Integrated circuit

An integrated circuit (IC), also known
as a microchip or simply chip, is a
compact assembly of electronic circuits
formed from various electronic
components — such as transistors,
resistors, and capacitors — and their
interconnections. These components are
fabricated onto a thin, flat piece
("chip") of semiconductor material,
most commonly silicon. Integrated
circuits are integral to a wide variety
of electronic devices — including
computers, smartphones, and televisions
— performing functions such as data
processing, control, and storage. They
have transformed the field of
electronics by enabling device
miniaturization, improving performance,
and reducing cost.
