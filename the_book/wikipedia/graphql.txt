GraphQL

GraphQL is a data query and
manipulation language that allows
specifying what data is to be retrieved
or modified. A GraphQL server can
process a client query using data from
separate sources and present the
results in a unified graph. The
language is not tied to any specific
database or storage engine. There are
several open-source runtime engines for
GraphQL.
