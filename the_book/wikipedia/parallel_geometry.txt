Parallel (geometry)

In geometry, parallel lines are
coplanar infinite straight lines that
do not intersect at any point. Parallel
planes are infinite flat planes in the
same three-dimensional space that never
meet. In three-dimensional Euclidean
space, a line and a plane that do not
share a point are also said to be
parallel. However, two noncoplanar
lines are called skew lines. Line
segments and Euclidean vectors are
parallel if they have the same
direction or opposite direction.
