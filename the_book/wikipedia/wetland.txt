Wetland

A wetland is a distinct semi-aquatic
ecosystem whose groundcovers are
flooded or saturated in water, either
permanently, for years or decades, or
only seasonally. Flooding results in
oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking
place, especially in the soils.
Wetlands form a transitional zone
between waterbodies and dry lands, and
are different from other terrestrial or
aquatic ecosystems due to their
vegetation's roots having adapted to
oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are
considered among the most biologically
diverse of all ecosystems, serving as
habitats to a wide range of aquatic and
semi-aquatic plants and animals, with
often improved water quality due to
plant removal of excess nutrients such
as nitrates and phosphorus.
