Alzheimer's disease

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a
neurodegenerative disease and is the
most common form of dementia,
accounting for around 6070% of cases.
The most common early symptom is
difficulty in remembering recent
events. As the disease advances,
symptoms can include problems with
language, disorientation, mood swings,
loss of motivation, self-neglect, and
behavioral issues. As a person's
condition declines, they often withdraw
from family and society. Gradually,
bodily functions are lost, ultimately
leading to death. Although the speed of
progression can vary, the average life
expectancy following diagnosis is three
to twelve years.
