Mumps

Mumps is a highly contagious viral
disease caused by the mumps virus.
Initial symptoms of mumps are
non-specific and include fever,
headache, malaise, muscle pain, and
loss of appetite. These symptoms are
usually followed by painful swelling
around the side of the face, which is
the most common symptom of a mumps
infection. Symptoms typically occur 16
to 18 days after exposure to the virus.
About one-third of people with a mumps
infection do not have any symptoms
(asymptomatic).
