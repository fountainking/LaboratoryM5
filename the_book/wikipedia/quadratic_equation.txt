In mathematics, a quadratic equation is
an equation that can be rearranged in
standard form as where the variable
represents an unknown number, and a, b,
and c represent known numbers, where a
0. The numbers a, b, and c are the
coefficients of the equation and may be
distinguished by respectively calling
them, the quadratic coefficient, the
linear coefficient and the constant
coefficient or free term.
