Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi is a family of wireless network
protocols based on the IEEE 802.11
family of standards, which are commonly
used for local area networking of
devices and Internet access, allowing
nearby digital devices to exchange data
by radio waves. These are the most
widely used computer networks, used
globally in home and small office
networks to link devices and to provide
Internet access with wireless routers
and wireless access points in public
places such as coffee shops,
restaurants, hotels, libraries, and
airports.
