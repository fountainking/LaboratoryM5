Cloning

Cloning is the process of producing
individual organisms with identical
genomes, either by natural or
artificial means. In nature, some
organisms produce clones through
asexual reproduction; this reproduction
of an organism by itself without a mate
is known as parthenogenesis. In the
field of biotechnology, cloning is the
process of creating cloned organisms of
cells and of DNA fragments.
