Inca Empire

The Inca Empire, officially known as
the Realm of the Four Parts, was the
largest empire in pre-Columbian
America. The administrative, political,
and military center of the empire was
in the city of Cusco. The Inca
civilisation rose from the Peruvian
highlands sometime in the early 13th
century. The Portuguese explorer Aleixo
Garcia was the first European to reach
the Inca Empire in 1524. Later, in
1532, the Spanish began the conquest of
the Inca Empire, and by 1572 the last
Inca state was fully conquered.
