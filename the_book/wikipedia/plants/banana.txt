Banana

A banana is an elongated, edible
fruit—botanically a berry—produced by
several kinds of large treelike
herbaceous flowering plants in the
genus Musa. In some countries, cooking
bananas are called plantains,
distinguishing them from dessert
bananas. The fruit is variable in size,
color and firmness, but is usually
elongated and curved, with soft flesh
rich in starch covered with a peel,
which may have a variety of colors when
ripe. It grows upward in clusters near
the top of the plant. Almost all modern
edible seedless (parthenocarp)
cultivated bananas come from two wild
species –Musa acuminata and Musa
balbisiana, or their hybrids.
