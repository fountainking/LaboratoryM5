Strawberry

The garden strawberry is a widely grown
hybrid plant cultivated worldwide for
its fruit. The genus Fragaria, the
strawberries, is in the rose family,
Rosaceae. The fruit is appreciated for
its aroma, bright red colour, juicy
texture, and sweetness. It is eaten
either fresh or in prepared foods such
as jam, ice cream, and chocolates.
Artificial strawberry flavourings and
aromas are widely used in commercial
products. Botanically, the strawberry
is not a berry, but an aggregate
accessory fruit. Each apparent 'seed'
on the outside of the strawberry is
actually an achene, a botanical fruit
with a seed inside it.
