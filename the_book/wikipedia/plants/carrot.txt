Carrot

The carrot is a root vegetable,
typically orange in colour, though
heirloom variants including purple,
black, red, white, and yellow cultivars
exist, all of which are domesticated
forms of the wild carrot, Daucus
carota, native to Europe and
Southwestern Asia. The plant probably
originated in Iran and was originally
cultivated for its leaves and seeds.
