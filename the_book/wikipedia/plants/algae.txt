Algae

Algae is an informal term for any
organisms of a large and diverse group
of photosynthetic organisms that are
not land plants, and includes species
from multiple distinct clades. Such
organisms range from unicellular
microalgae, such as cyanobacteria,
Chlorella, and diatoms, to
multicellular macroalgae such as kelp
or brown algae which may grow up to 50
metres (160 ft) in length. Most algae
are aquatic organisms and lack many of
the distinct cell and tissue types,
such as stomata, xylem, and phloem that
are found in land plants. The largest
and most complex marine algae are
called seaweeds. In contrast, the most
complex freshwater forms are the
Charophyta, a division of green algae
which includes, for example, Spirogyra
and stoneworts. Algae that are carried
passively by water are plankton,
specifically phytoplankton.
