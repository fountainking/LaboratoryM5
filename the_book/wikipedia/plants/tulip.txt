Tulip

Tulips are spring-blooming perennial
herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes in the
Tulipa genus. Their flowers are usually
large, showy, and brightly coloured,
generally red, orange, pink, yellow, or
white. They often have a different
coloured blotch at the base of the
tepals, internally. Because of a degree
of variability within the populations
and a long history of cultivation,
classification has been complex and
controversial. The tulip is a member of
the lily family, Liliaceae, along with
14 other genera, where it is most
closely related to Amana, Erythronium,
and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae.
