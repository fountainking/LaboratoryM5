Maize

Maize, also known as corn in North
American English, is a tall stout grass
that produces cereal grain. The leafy
stalk of the plant gives rise to male
inflorescences or tassels which produce
pollen, and female inflorescences
called ears. The ears yield grain,
known as kernels or seeds. In modern
commercial varieties, these are usually
yellow or white; other varieties can be
of many colors. Maize was domesticated
by indigenous peoples in southern
Mexico about 9,000 years ago from wild
teosinte. Native Americans planted it
alongside beans and squashes in the
Three Sisters polyculture.
