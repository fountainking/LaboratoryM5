Apple

An apple is the round, edible fruit of
an apple tree. Fruit trees of the
orchard or domestic apple, the most
widely grown in the genus, are
cultivated worldwide. The tree
originated in Central Asia, where its
wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is
still found. Apples have been grown for
thousands of years in Eurasia before
they were introduced to North America
by European colonists. Apples have
cultural significance in many
mythologies and religions.
