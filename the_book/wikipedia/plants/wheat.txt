Wheat

Wheat is a group of wild and
domesticated grasses of the genus
Triticum. They are cultivated for their
cereal grains, which are staple foods
around the world. Well-known wheat
species and hybrids include the most
widely grown common wheat, spelt,
durum, emmer, einkorn, and Khorasan or
Kamut. The archaeological record
suggests that wheat was first
cultivated in the regions of the
Fertile Crescent around 9600 BC.
