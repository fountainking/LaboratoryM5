Barley

Barley, a member of the grass family,
is a major cereal grain grown in
temperate climates globally. One of the
first cultivated grains, it was
domesticated in the Fertile Crescent
around 9000 BC, giving it nonshattering
spikelets and making it much easier to
harvest. Its use then spread throughout
Eurasia by 2000 BC. Barley prefers
relatively low temperatures and
well-drained soil to grow. It is
relatively tolerant of drought and soil
salinity, but is less winter-hardy than
wheat or rye.
