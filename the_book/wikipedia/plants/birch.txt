Birch

A birch is a thin-leaved deciduous
hardwood tree of the genus Betula, in
the family Betulaceae, which also
includes alders, hazels, and hornbeams.
It is closely related to the beech-oak
family Fagaceae. The genus Betula
contains 30 to 60 known taxa of which
11 are on the IUCN 2011 Red List of
Threatened Species. They are typically
short-lived pioneer species and are
widespread in the Northern Hemisphere,
particularly in northern areas of
temperate climates and in boreal
climates. Birch wood is used for a wide
range of purposes.
