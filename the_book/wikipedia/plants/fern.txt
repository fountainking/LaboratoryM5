Fern

The ferns are a group of vascular
plants that reproduce via spores and
have neither seeds nor flowers. They
differ from non-vascular plants by
having specialized transport bundles
that conduct water and nutrients from
and to the roots, as well as life
cycles in which the branched sporophyte
is the dominant phase.
