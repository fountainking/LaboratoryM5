Lilium

Lilium is a genus of herbaceous
flowering plants growing from bulbs,
all with large and often prominent
flowers. Lilies are a group of
flowering plants which are important in
culture and literature in much of the
world. Most species are native to the
Northern Hemisphere and their range is
temperate climates and extends into the
subtropics. Many other plants have
"lily" in their common names, but do
not belong to the same genus and are
therefore not true lilies. True lilies
are known to be highly toxic to cats.
