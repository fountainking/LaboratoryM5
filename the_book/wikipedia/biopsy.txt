Biopsy

A biopsy is a medical test commonly
performed by a surgeon, an
interventional radiologist, or an
interventional cardiologist. The
process involves the extraction of
sample cells or tissues for examination
to determine the presence or extent of
a disease. The tissue is then fixed,
dehydrated, embedded, sectioned,
stained and mounted before it is
generally examined under a microscope
by a pathologist; it may also be
analyzed chemically. When an entire
lump or suspicious area is removed, the
procedure is called an excisional
biopsy. An incisional biopsy or core
biopsy samples a portion of the
abnormal tissue without attempting to
remove the entire lesion or tumor. When
a sample of tissue or fluid is removed
with a needle in such a way that cells
are removed without preserving the
histological architecture of the tissue
cells, the procedure is called a needle
aspiration biopsy. Biopsies are most
commonly performed for insight into
possible cancerous or inflammatory
conditions.
