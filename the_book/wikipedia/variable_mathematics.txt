Variable (mathematics)

In mathematics, a variable is a symbol,
typically a letter, that refers to an
unspecified mathematical object. One
says colloquially that the variable
represents or denotes the object, and
that any valid candidate for the object
is the value of the variable. The
values a variable can take are usually
of the same kind, often numbers. More
specifically, the values involved may
form a set, such as the set of real
numbers.
