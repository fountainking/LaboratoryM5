Niagara Falls

Niagara Falls is a group of three
waterfalls at the southern end of
Niagara Gorge, spanning the border
between the province of Ontario in
Canada and the state of New York in the
United States. The largest of the three
is Horseshoe Falls, which straddles the
international border of the two
countries. It is also known as the
Canadian Falls. The smaller American
Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie within
the United States. Bridal Veil Falls is
separated from Horseshoe Falls by Goat
Island and from American Falls by Luna
Island, with both islands situated in
New York.
