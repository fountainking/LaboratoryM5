Wheelchair

A wheelchair is a mobilized form of
chair using two or more wheels, a
footrest, and an armrest usually
cushioned. It is used when walking is
difficult or impossible to do due to
illnesses, injury, disabilities, or
age-related health conditions.
Wheelchairs provide mobility, postural
support, and freedom to those who
cannot walk or have difficulty walking,
enabling them to move around,
participate in everyday activities, and
live life on their own terms.
