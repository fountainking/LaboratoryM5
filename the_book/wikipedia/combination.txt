Combination

In mathematics, a combination is a
selection of items from a set that has
distinct members, such that the order
of selection does not matter. For
example, given three fruits, say an
apple, an orange and a pear, there are
three combinations of two that can be
drawn from this set: an apple and a
pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear
and an orange. More formally, a
k-combination of a set S is a subset of
k distinct elements of S. So, two
combinations are identical if and only
if each combination has the same
members. If the set has n elements, the
number of k-combinations, denoted by or
, is equal to the binomial coefficient
