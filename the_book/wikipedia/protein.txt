Protein

Proteins are large biomolecules and
macromolecules that comprise one or
more long chains of amino acid
residues. Proteins perform a vast array
of functions within organisms,
including catalysing metabolic
reactions, DNA replication, responding
to stimuli, providing structure to
cells and organisms, and transporting
molecules from one location to another.
Proteins differ from one another
primarily in their sequence of amino
acids, which is dictated by the
nucleotide sequence of their genes, and
which usually results in protein
folding into a specific 3D structure
that determines its activity.
