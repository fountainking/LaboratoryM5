Childbirth

Childbirth, also known as labour,
parturition and delivery, is the
completion of pregnancy, where one or
more fetuses exits the internal
environment of the mother via vaginal
delivery or caesarean section and
becomes a newborn to the world. In
2019, there were about 140.11million
human births globally. In developed
countries, most deliveries occur in
hospitals, while in developing
countries most are home births.
