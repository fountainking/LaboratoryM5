Avalanche

An avalanche is a rapid flow of snow
down a slope, such as a hill or
mountain. Avalanches can be triggered
spontaneously, by factors such as
increased precipitation or snowpack
weakening, or by external means such as
humans, other animals, and earthquakes.
Primarily composed of flowing snow and
air, large avalanches have the
capability to capture and move ice,
rocks, and trees.
