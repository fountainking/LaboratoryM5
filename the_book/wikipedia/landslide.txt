Landslide

Landslides, also known as landslips,
rockslips or rockslides, are several
forms of mass wasting that may include
a wide range of ground movements, such
as rockfalls, mudflows, shallow or
deep-seated slope failures and debris
flows. Landslides occur in a variety of
environments, characterized by either
steep or gentle slope gradients, from
mountain ranges to coastal cliffs or
even underwater, in which case they are
called submarine landslides.
