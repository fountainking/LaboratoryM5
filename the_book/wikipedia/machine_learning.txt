Machine learning

Machine learning (ML) is a field of
study in artificial intelligence
concerned with the development and
study of statistical algorithms that
can learn from data and generalise to
unseen data, and thus perform tasks
without explicit instructions. Within a
subdiscipline in machine learning,
advances in the field of deep learning
have allowed neural networks, a class
of statistical algorithms, to surpass
many previous machine learning
approaches in performance.
