Antimicrobial resistance

Antimicrobial resistance occurs when
microbes evolve mechanisms that protect
them from antimicrobials, which are
drugs used to treat infections. This
resistance affects all classes of
microbes, including bacteria, viruses,
parasites, and fungi. Together, these
adaptations fall under the AMR
umbrella, posing significant challenges
to healthcare worldwide. Misuse and
improper management of antimicrobials
are primary drivers of this resistance,
though it can also occur naturally
through genetic mutations and the
spread of resistant genes.
