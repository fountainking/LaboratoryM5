Area

Area is the measure of a region's size
on a surface. The area of a plane
region or plane area refers to the area
of a shape or planar lamina, while
surface area refers to the area of an
open surface or the boundary of a
three-dimensional object. Area can be
understood as the amount of material
with a given thickness that would be
necessary to fashion a model of the
shape, or the amount of paint necessary
to cover the surface with a single
coat. It is the two-dimensional
analogue of the length of a curve or
the volume of a solid . Two different
regions may have the same area ; by
synecdoche, "area" sometimes is used to
refer to the region, as in a "polygonal
area".
