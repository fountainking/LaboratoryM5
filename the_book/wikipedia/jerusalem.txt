Jerusalem

Jerusalem is a city in the Southern
Levant, on a plateau in the Judaean
Mountains between the Mediterranean and
the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest
cities in the world, and is considered
holy to the three major Abrahamic
religionsJudaism, Christianity and
Islam. Both Israel and Palestine claim
Jerusalem as their capital city; Israel
maintains its primary governmental
institutions there, while Palestine
ultimately foresees it as its seat of
power. Neither claim is widely
recognised internationally.
