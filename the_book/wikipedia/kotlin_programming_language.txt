**KOTLIN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE**

---------------------------------------

Kotlin (programming language)

Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically
typed, general-purpose high-level
programming language with type
inference. Kotlin is designed to
interoperate fully with Java, and the
JVM version of Kotlin's standard
library depends on the Java Class
Library, but type inference allows its
syntax to be more concise. Kotlin
mainly targets the JVM, but also
compiles to JavaScript or native code
via LLVM. Language development costs
are borne by JetBrains, while the
Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin
trademark.
