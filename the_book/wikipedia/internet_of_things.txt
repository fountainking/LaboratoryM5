Internet of things

The Internet of Things (IoT) describes
physical objects that are embedded with
sensors, processing ability, software,
and other technologies that connect and
exchange data with other devices and
systems over the internet or other
communication networks. The IoT
encompasses electronics, communication,
and computer science engineering.
"Internet of Things" has been
considered a misnomer because devices
do not need to be connected to the
public internet; they only need to be
connected to a network and be
individually addressable.
