Continuous integration

Continuous integration (CI) is the
practice of integrating source code
changes frequently and ensuring that
the integrated codebase is in a
workable state. Typically, developers
merge changes to an integration branch,
and an automated system builds and
tests the software system. Often, the
automated process runs on each commit
or runs on a schedule such as once a
day. Grady Booch first proposed the
term CI in 1991, although he did not
advocate integrating multiple times a
day, but later, CI came to include that
aspect.
