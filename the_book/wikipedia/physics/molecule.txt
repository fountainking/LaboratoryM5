Molecule

A molecule is a group of two or more
atoms that are held together by
attractive forces known as chemical
bonds; depending on context, the term
may or may not include ions that
satisfy this criterion. In quantum
physics, organic chemistry, and
biochemistry, the distinction from ions
is dropped and molecule is often used
when referring to polyatomic ions.
