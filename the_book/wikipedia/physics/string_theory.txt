String theory

In physics, string theory is a
theoretical framework in which the
point-like particles of particle
physics are replaced by one-dimensional
objects called strings. String theory
describes how these strings propagate
through space and interact with each
other. On distance scales larger than
the string scale, a string acts like a
particle, with its mass, charge, and
other properties determined by the
vibrational state of the string. In
string theory, one of the many
vibrational states of the string
corresponds to the graviton, a quantum
mechanical particle that carries the
gravitational force. Thus, string
theory is a theory of quantum gravity.
