Conservation of energy

The law of conservation of energy
states that the total energy of an
isolated system remains constant; it is
said to be conserved over time. In the
case of a closed system, the principle
says that the total amount of energy
within the system can only be changed
through energy entering or leaving the
system. Energy can neither be created
nor destroyed; rather, it can only be
transformed or transferred from one
form to another. For instance, chemical
energy is converted to kinetic energy
when a stick of dynamite explodes. If
one adds up all forms of energy that
were released in the explosion, such as
the kinetic energy and potential energy
of the pieces, as well as heat and
sound, one will get the exact decrease
of chemical energy in the combustion of
the dynamite.
