Newton's laws of motion

Newton's laws of motion are three
physical laws that describe the
relationship between the motion of an
object and the forces acting on it.
These laws, which provide the basis for
Newtonian mechanics, can be paraphrased
as follows:A body remains at rest, or
in motion at a constant speed in a
straight line, unless it is acted upon
by a force.
At any instant of time, the net force
on a body is equal to the body's
acceleration multiplied by its mass or,
equivalently, the rate at which the
body's momentum is changing with time.
If two bodies exert forces on each
other, these forces have the same
magnitude but opposite directions.
