Atomic physics

Atomic physics is the field of physics
that studies atoms as an isolated
system of electrons and an atomic
nucleus. Atomic physics typically
refers to the study of atomic structure
and the interaction between atoms. It
is primarily concerned with the way in
which electrons are arranged around the
nucleus and
the processes by which these
arrangements change. This comprises
ions, neutral atoms and, unless
otherwise stated, it can be assumed
that the term atom includes ions.
