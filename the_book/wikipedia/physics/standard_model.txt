Standard Model

The Standard Model of particle physics
is the theory describing three of the
four known fundamental forces in the
universe and classifying all known
elementary particles. It was developed
in stages throughout the latter half of
the 20th century, through the work of
many scientists worldwide, with the
current formulation being finalized in
the mid-1970s upon experimental
confirmation of the existence of
quarks. Since then, proof of the top
quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000),
and the Higgs boson (2012) have added
further credence to the Standard Model.
In addition, the Standard Model has
predicted various properties of weak
neutral currents and the W and Z bosons
with great accuracy.
