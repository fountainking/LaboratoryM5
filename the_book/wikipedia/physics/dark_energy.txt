Dark energy

In physical cosmology and astronomy,
dark energy is a proposed form of
energy that affects the universe on the
largest scales. Its primary effect is
to drive the accelerating expansion of
the universe. It also slows the rate of
structure formation. Assuming that the
lambda-CDM model of cosmology is
correct, dark energy dominates the
universe, contributing 68% of the total
energy in the present-day observable
universe while dark matter and ordinary
(baryonic) matter contribute 27% and
5%, respectively, and other components
such as neutrinos and photons are
nearly negligible. Dark energy's
density is very low: 7×10−30 g/cm3,
much less than the density of ordinary
matter or dark matter within galaxies.
However, it dominates the universe's
mass–energy content because it is
uniform across space.
