General relativity

General relativity, also known as the
general theory of relativity, and as
Einstein's theory of gravity, is the
geometric theory of gravitation
published by Albert Einstein in 1915
and is the accepted description of
gravitation in modern physics. General
relativity generalizes special
relativity and refines Newton's law of
universal gravitation, providing a
unified description of gravity as a
geometric property of space and time,
or four-dimensional spacetime. In
particular, the curvature of spacetime
is directly related to the energy,
momentum and stress of whatever is
present, including matter and
radiation. The relation is specified by
the Einstein field equations, a system
of second-order partial differential
equations.
