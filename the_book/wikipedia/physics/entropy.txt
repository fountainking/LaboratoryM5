The term and the concept are used in
diverse fields, from classical
thermodynamics, where it was first
recognized, to the microscopic
description of nature in statistical
physics, and to the principles of
information theory. It has found
far-ranging applications in chemistry
and physics, in biological systems and
their relation to life, in cosmology,
