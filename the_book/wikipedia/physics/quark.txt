Quark

A quark is a type of elementary
particle and a fundamental constituent
of matter. Quarks combine to form
composite particles called hadrons, the
most stable of which are protons and
neutrons, the components of atomic
nuclei. All commonly observable matter
is composed of up quarks, down quarks
and electrons. Owing to a phenomenon
known as color confinement, quarks are
never found in isolation; they can be
found only within hadrons, which
include baryons and mesons, or in
quark–gluon plasmas. For this reason,
much of what is known about quarks has
been drawn from observations of
hadrons.
