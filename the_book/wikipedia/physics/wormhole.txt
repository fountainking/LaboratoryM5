**WORMHOLE**

Wormhole

A wormhole is a hypothetical structure
that connects disparate points in
spacetime. It can be visualized as a
tunnel with two ends at separate points
in spacetime. Wormholes are based on a
special solution of the Einstein field
equations.
Wormholes are consistent with the
general theory of relativity, but
whether they actually exist is unknown.
Many physicists postulate that
wormholes are merely projections of a
fourth spatial dimension, analogous to
how a two-dimensional (2D) being could
experience only part of a
three-dimensional (3D) object.
