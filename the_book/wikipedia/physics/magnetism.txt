Magnetism

Magnetism is the class of physical
attributes that occur through a
magnetic field, which allows objects to
attract or repel each other. Because
both electric currents and magnetic
moments of elementary particles give
rise to a magnetic field, magnetism is
one of two aspects of electromagnetism.
