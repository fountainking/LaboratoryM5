Special relativity

In physics, the special theory of
relativity, or special relativity for
short, is a scientific theory of the
relationship between space and time. In
Albert Einstein's 1905 paper,
"On the Electrodynamics of Moving
Bodies", the theory is presented as
being based on just two postulates:The
laws of physics are invariant
(identical) in all inertial frames of
reference. This is known as the
principle of relativity.
The speed of light in vacuum is the
same for all observers, regardless of
the motion of light source or observer.
This is known as the principle of light
constancy, or the principle of light
speed invariance.
