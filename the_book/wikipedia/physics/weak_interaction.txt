Weak interaction

In nuclear physics and particle
physics, the weak interaction, weak
force or the weak nuclear force, is one
of the four known fundamental
interactions, with the others being
electromagnetism, the strong
interaction, and gravitation. It is the
mechanism of interaction between
subatomic particles that is responsible
for the radioactive decay of atoms: The
weak interaction participates in
nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. The
theory describing its behaviour and
effects is sometimes called quantum
flavordynamics (QFD); however, the term
QFD is rarely used, because the weak
force is better understood by
electroweak theory (EWT).
