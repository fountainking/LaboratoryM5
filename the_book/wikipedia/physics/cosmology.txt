Cosmology

Cosmology is a branch of physics and
metaphysics dealing with the nature of
the universe, the cosmos. The term
cosmology was first used in English in
1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia,
with the meaning of "a speaking of the
world". In 1731, German philosopher
Christian Wolff used the term cosmology
in Latin (cosmologia) to denote a
branch of metaphysics that deals with
the general nature of the physical
world. Religious or mythological
cosmology is a body of beliefs based on
mythological, religious, and esoteric
literature and traditions of creation
myths and eschatology. In the science
of astronomy, cosmology is concerned
with the study of the chronology of the
universe.
