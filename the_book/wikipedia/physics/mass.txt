**MASS**

---------------------------------------

Mass

Mass is an intrinsic property of a
body. It was traditionally believed to
be related to the quantity of matter in
a body, until the discovery of the atom
and particle physics. It was found that
different atoms and different
elementary particles, theoretically
with the same amount of matter, have
nonetheless different masses. Mass in
modern physics has multiple definitions
which are conceptually distinct, but
physically equivalent. Mass can be
experimentally defined as a measure of
the body's inertia, meaning the
resistance to acceleration when a net
force is applied. The object's mass
also determines the strength of its
gravitational attraction to other
bodies.
