Wave

In physics, mathematics, engineering,
and related fields, a wave is a
propagating dynamic disturbance of one
or more quantities. Periodic waves
oscillate repeatedly about an
equilibrium (resting) value at some
frequency. When the entire waveform
moves in one direction, it is said to
be a travelling wave; by contrast, a
pair of superimposed periodic waves
traveling in opposite directions makes
a standing wave. In a standing wave,
the amplitude of vibration has nulls at
some positions where the wave amplitude
appears smaller or even zero.
