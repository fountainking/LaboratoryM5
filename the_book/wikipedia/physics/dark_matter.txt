Dark matter

In astronomy and cosmology, dark matter
is an invisible and hypothetical form
of matter that does not interact with
light or other electromagnetic
radiation. Dark matter is implied by
gravitational effects that cannot be
explained by general relativity unless
more matter is present than can be
observed. Such effects occur in the
context of formation and evolution of
galaxies, gravitational lensing, the
observable universe's current
structure, mass position in galactic
collisions, the motion of galaxies
within galaxy clusters, and cosmic
microwave background anisotropies. Dark
matter is thought to serve as
gravitational scaffolding for cosmic
structures.
After the Big Bang, dark matter clumped
into blobs along narrow filaments with
superclusters of galaxies forming a
cosmic web at scales on which entire
galaxies appear like tiny particles.
