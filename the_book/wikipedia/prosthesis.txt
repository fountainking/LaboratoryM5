Prosthesis

In medicine, a prosthesis, or a
prosthetic implant, is an artificial
device that replaces a missing body
part, which may be lost through
physical trauma, disease, or a
condition present at birth. Prostheses
may restore the normal functions of the
missing body part, or may perform a
cosmetic function.
