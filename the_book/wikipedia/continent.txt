Continent

A continent is any of several large
terrestrial geographical regions.
Continents are generally identified by
convention rather than any strict
criteria. A continent could be a single
large landmass, a part of a very large
landmass, as in the case of Asia or
Europe within Eurasia, or a landmass
and nearby islands within its
continental shelf. Due to these varying
definitions, the number of continents
varies; up to seven or as few as four
geographical regions are commonly
regarded as continents. Most
English-speaking countries recognize
seven regions as continents. In order
from largest to smallest in area, these
seven regions are Asia, Africa, North
America, South America, Antarctica,
Europe, and Australia. Different
variations with fewer continents merge
some of these regions; examples of this
are merging Asia and Europe into
Eurasia, North America and South
America into the Americas, and Africa,
Asia, and Europe into Afro-Eurasia.
