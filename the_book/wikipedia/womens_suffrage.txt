Women's suffrage

Women's suffrage is the right of women
to vote in elections. Historically,
women rarely had the right to vote,
even in ostensibly democratic systems
of government. This shifted in the late
19th century when women's suffrage was
accomplished in Australasia, then
Europe, and then the Americas. By the
middle of the 20th century, women's
suffrage had been established as a norm
of democratic governance. Extended
political campaigns by women and their
male supporters played an important
role in changing public attitude,
altering norms, and achieving
legislation or constitutional
amendments for women's suffrage.
