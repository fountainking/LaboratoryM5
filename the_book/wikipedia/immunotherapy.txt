Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy, also known as biological
therapy or biotherapy, encompasses a
diverse set of therapeutic strategies
that harness or modify the immune
system to prevent, control, or
eliminate disease. In its narrowest
definition, immunotherapy refers to
treatments designed to stimulate or
guide the immune system to recognize
and fight cancer, often by enhancing or
restoring immune responses to eradicate
malignant cells while sparing healthy
tissue.
