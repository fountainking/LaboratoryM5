Wind turbine

A wind turbine is a device that
converts the kinetic energy of wind
into electrical energy. As of 2020,
hundreds of thousands of large
turbines, in installations known as
wind farms, were generating over 650
gigawatts of power, with 60 GW added
each year. Wind turbines are an
increasingly important source of
intermittent renewable energy, and are
used in many countries to lower energy
costs and reduce reliance on fossil
fuels. One study claimed that, as of
2009, wind had the "lowest relative
greenhouse gas emissions, the least
water consumption demands and the most
favorable social impacts" compared to
photovoltaic, hydro, geothermal, coal
and gas energy sources.
