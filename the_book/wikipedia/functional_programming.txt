Functional programming

In computer science, functional
programming is a programming paradigm
where programs are constructed by
applying and composing functions. It is
a declarative programming paradigm in
which function definitions are trees of
expressions that map values to other
values, rather than a sequence of
imperative statements which update the
running state of the program.
