Apache Groovy

Apache Groovy is a
Java-syntax-compatible object-oriented
programming language for the Java
platform. It is both a static and
dynamic language with features similar
to those of Python, Ruby, and
Smalltalk. It can be used as both a
programming language and a scripting
language for the Java Platform, is
compiled to Java virtual machine (JVM)
bytecode, and interoperates seamlessly
with other Java code and libraries.
Groovy uses a curly-bracket syntax
similar to Java's. Groovy supports
closures, multiline strings, and
expressions embedded in strings. Much
of Groovy's power lies in its AST
transformations, triggered through
annotations.
