Japan

Japan is an island country in East
Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean off
the northeast coast of the Asian
mainland, it is bordered to the west by
the Sea of Japan and extends from the
Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East
China Sea in the south. The Japanese
archipelago consists of four major
islands alongside 14,121 smaller
islands, covering 377,975 square
kilometers (145,937sqmi). Divided into
47 administrative prefectures and eight
traditional regions, about 75% of the
country's terrain is mountainous and
heavily forested, concentrating its
agriculture and highly urbanized
population along its eastern coastal
plains. With a population of over
123million as of 2025, it is the 11th
most populous country. The country's
capital and largest city is Tokyo.
