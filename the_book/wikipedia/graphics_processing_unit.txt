Graphics processing unit

A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a
specialized electronic circuit designed
for digital image processing and to
accelerate computer graphics, being
present either as a component on a
discrete graphics card or embedded on
motherboards, mobile phones, personal
computers, workstations, and game
consoles. GPUs were later found to be
useful for non-graphic calculations
involving embarrassingly parallel
problems due to their parallel
structure. The ability of GPUs to
rapidly perform vast numbers of
calculations has led to their adoption
in diverse fields including artificial
intelligence (AI) where they excel at
handling data-intensive and
computationally demanding tasks. Other
non-graphical uses include the training
of neural networks and cryptocurrency
mining.
