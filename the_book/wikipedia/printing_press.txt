Printing press

A printing press is a mechanical device
for applying pressure to an inked
surface resting upon a print medium,
thereby transferring the ink. It marked
a dramatic improvement on earlier
printing methods in which the cloth,
paper, or other medium was brushed or
rubbed repeatedly to achieve the
transfer of ink and accelerated the
process. Typically used for texts, the
invention and global spread of the
printing press was one of the most
influential events in the second
millennium.
