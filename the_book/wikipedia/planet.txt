Planet

A planet is a large, rounded
astronomical body that is generally
required to be in orbit around a star,
stellar remnant, or brown dwarf, and is
not one itself. The Solar System has
eight planets by the most restrictive
definition of the term: the terrestrial
planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and
Mars, and the giant planets Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The best
available theory of planet formation is
the nebular hypothesis, which posits
that an interstellar cloud collapses
out of a nebula to create a young
protostar orbited by a protoplanetary
disk. Planets grow in this disk by the
gradual accumulation of material driven
by gravity, a process called accretion.
