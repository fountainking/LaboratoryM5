Virus

A virus is a submicroscopic infectious
agent that replicates only inside the
living cells of an organism. Viruses
infect all life forms, from animals and
plants to microorganisms, including
bacteria and archaea. Viruses are found
in almost every ecosystem on Earth and
are the most numerous type of
biological entity. Since Dmitri
Ivanovsky's 1892 article describing a
non-bacterial pathogen infecting
tobacco plants and the discovery of the
tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus
Beijerinck in 1898, more than 16,000 of
the millions of virus species have been
described in detail. The study of
viruses is known as virology, a
subspeciality of microbiology.
