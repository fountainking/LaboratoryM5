Chemistry

Chemistry is the scientific study of
the properties and behavior of matter.
It is a physical science within the
natural sciences that studies the
chemical elements that make up matter
and compounds made of atoms, molecules
and ions: their composition, structure,
properties, behavior and the changes
they undergo during reactions with
other substances. Chemistry also
addresses the nature of chemical bonds
in chemical compounds.
