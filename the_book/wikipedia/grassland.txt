Grassland

A grassland is an area where the
vegetation is dominated by grasses.
However, sedges and rushes can also be
found along with variable proportions
of legumes such as clover, and other
herbs. Grasslands occur naturally on
all continents except Antarctica and
are found in most ecoregions of the
Earth. Furthermore, grasslands are one
of the largest biomes on Earth and
dominate the landscape worldwide. There
are different types of grasslands:
natural grasslands, semi-natural
grasslands, and agricultural
grasslands. They cover 3169% of the
Earth's land area.
