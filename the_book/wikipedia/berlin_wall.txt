Berlin Wall

The Berlin Wall, officially the
Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart, was a
guarded concrete barrier that encircled
West Berlin from 1961 to 1989,
separating it from East Berlin and the
German Democratic Republic.
Construction of the Berlin Wall was
commenced by the government of the GDR
on 13 August 1961. It included guard
towers placed along large concrete
walls, accompanied by a wide area that
contained anti-vehicle trenches, beds
of nails and other defenses. The
primary intention for the Wall's
construction was to prevent East German
citizens from fleeing to the West.
