Roman Empire

The Roman Empire ruled the
Mediterranean and much of Europe,
Western Asia and North Africa. The
Romans conquered most of this during
the Republic, and it was ruled by
emperors following Octavian's
assumption of effective sole rule in 27
BC. The western empire collapsed in 476
AD, but the eastern empire lasted until
the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.
