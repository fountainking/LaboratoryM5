Random-access memory

Random-access memory is a form of
electronic computer memory that can be
read and changed in any order,
typically used to store working data
and machine code. A random-access
memory device allows data items to be
read or written in almost the same
amount of time irrespective of the
physical location of data inside the
memory, in contrast with other
direct-access data storage media, where
the time required to read and write
data items varies significantly
depending on their physical locations
on the recording medium, due to
mechanical limitations such as media
rotation speeds and arm movement.
