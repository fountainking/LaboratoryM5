Television

Television (TV) is a telecommunication
medium for transmitting moving images
and sound. Additionally, the term can
refer to a physical television set
rather than the medium of transmission.
Television is a mass medium for
advertising, entertainment, news, and
sports. The medium is capable of more
than "radio broadcasting", which refers
to an audio signal sent to radio
receivers.
