Constant (mathematics)

In mathematics, the word constant
conveys multiple meanings. As an
adjective, it refers to non-variance ;
as a noun, it has two different
meanings:A fixed and well-defined
number or other non-changing
mathematical object, or the symbol
denoting it. The terms mathematical
constant or physical constant are
sometimes used to distinguish this
meaning. A function whose value remains
unchanged. Such a constant is commonly
represented by a variable which does
not depend on the main variable(s) in
question.
