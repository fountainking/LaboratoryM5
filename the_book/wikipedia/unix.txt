Unix

Unix is a family of multitasking,
multi-user computer operating systems
that derive from the original AT&T
Unix, whose development started in 1969
at the Bell Labs research center by Ken
Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.
Initially intended for use inside the
Bell System, AT&T licensed Unix to
outside parties in the late 1970s,
leading to a variety of both academic
and commercial Unix variants from
vendors including University of
California, Berkeley (BSD), Microsoft
(Xenix), Sun Microsystems
(SunOS/Solaris), HP/HPE (HP-UX), and
**IBM (AIX).**
