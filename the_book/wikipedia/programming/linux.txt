Linux

Linux is a family of open source
Unix-like operating systems based on
the Linux kernel, an operating system
kernel first released on September 17,
1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is
typically packaged as a Linux
distribution (distro), which includes
the kernel and supporting system
software and libraries—most of which
are provided by third parties—to create
a complete operating system, designed
as a clone of Unix and released under
the copyleft GPL license.
