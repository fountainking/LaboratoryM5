C (programming language)

C is a general-purpose programming
language. It was created in the 1970s
by Dennis Ritchie and remains widely
used and influential. By design, C
gives the programmer relatively direct
access to the features of the typical
CPU architecture, customized for the
target instruction set. It has been and
continues to be used to implement
operating systems, device drivers, and
protocol stacks, but its use in
application software has been
decreasing. C is used on computers that
range from the largest supercomputers
to the smallest microcontrollers and
embedded systems.
