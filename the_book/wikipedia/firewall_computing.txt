Firewall (computing)

In computing, a firewall is a network
security system that monitors and
controls incoming and outgoing network
traffic based on configurable security
rules. A firewall typically establishes
a barrier between a trusted network and
an untrusted network, such as the
Internet or between several VLANs.
Firewalls can be categorized as
network-based or host-based.
