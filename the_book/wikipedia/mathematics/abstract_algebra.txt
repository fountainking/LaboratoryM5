Abstract algebra

In mathematics, more specifically
algebra, abstract algebra or modern
algebra is the study of algebraic
structures, which are sets with
specific operations acting on their
elements. Algebraic structures include
groups, rings, fields, modules, vector
spaces, lattices, and algebras over a
field. The term abstract algebra was
coined in the early 20th century to
distinguish it from older parts of
algebra, and more specifically from
elementary algebra, the use of
variables to represent numbers in
computation and reasoning. The abstract
perspective on algebra has become so
fundamental to advanced mathematics
that it is simply called "algebra",
while the term "abstract algebra" is
seldom used except in pedagogy.
