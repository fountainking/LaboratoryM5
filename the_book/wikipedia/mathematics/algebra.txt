Algebra

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that
deals with abstract systems, known as
algebraic structures, and the
manipulation of expressions within
those systems. It is a generalization
of arithmetic that introduces variables
and algebraic operations other than the
standard arithmetic operations, such as
addition and multiplication.
