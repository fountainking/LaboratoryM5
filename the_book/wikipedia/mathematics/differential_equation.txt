Differential equation

In mathematics, a differential equation
is an equation that relates one or more
unknown functions and their
derivatives. In applications, the
functions generally represent physical
quantities, the derivatives represent
their rates of change, and the
differential equation defines a
relationship between the two. Such
relations are common in mathematical
models and scientific laws; therefore,
differential equations play a prominent
role in many disciplines including
engineering, physics, economics, and
biology.
