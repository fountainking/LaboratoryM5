Statistics

Statistics is the discipline that
concerns the collection, organization,
analysis, interpretation, and
presentation of data. In applying
statistics to a scientific, industrial,
or social problem, it is conventional
to begin with a statistical population
or a statistical model to be studied.
Populations can be diverse groups of
people or objects such as "all people
living in a country" or "every atom
composing a crystal". Statistics deals
with every aspect of data, including
the planning of data collection in
terms of the design of surveys and
experiments.
