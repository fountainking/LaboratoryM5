Pi

The number π is a mathematical
constant, approximately equal to
3.14159, that is the ratio of a
circle's circumference to its diameter.
It appears in many formulae across
mathematics and physics, and some of
these formulae are commonly used for
defining π, to avoid relying on the
definition of the length of a curve.
