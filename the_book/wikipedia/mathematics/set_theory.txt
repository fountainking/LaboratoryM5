Set theory

Set theory is the branch of
mathematical logic that studies sets,
which can be informally described as
collections of objects. Although
objects of any kind can be collected
into a set, set theory – as a branch of
mathematics – is mostly concerned with
those that are relevant to mathematics
as a whole.
