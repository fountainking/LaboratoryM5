Probability

Probability is a branch of mathematics
and statistics concerning events and
numerical descriptions of how likely
they are to occur. The probability of
an event is a number between 0 and 1;
the larger the probability, the more
likely an event is to occur. This
number is often expressed as a
percentage (%), ranging from 0% to
100%. A simple example is the tossing
of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the
coin is fair, the two outcomes are both
equally probable; the probability of
"heads" equals the probability of
"tails"; and since no other outcomes
are possible, the probability of either
"heads" or "tails" is 1/2.
