Game theory

Game theory is the study of
mathematical models of strategic
interactions. It has applications in
many fields of social science, and is
used extensively in economics, logic,
systems science and computer science.
Initially, game theory addressed
two-person zero-sum games, in which a
participant's gains or losses are
exactly balanced by the losses and
gains of the other participant. In the
1950s, it was extended to the study of
non zero-sum games, and was eventually
applied to a wide range of behavioral
relations. It is now an umbrella term
for the science of rational decision
making in humans, animals, and
computers.
