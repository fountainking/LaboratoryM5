Euclidean geometry

Euclidean geometry is a mathematical
system attributed to Euclid, an ancient
Greek mathematician, which he described
in his textbook on geometry, Elements.
Euclid's approach consists in assuming
a small set of intuitively appealing
axioms (postulates) and deducing many
other propositions (theorems) from
these. One of those is the parallel
postulate which relates to parallel
lines on a Euclidean plane. Although
many of Euclid's results had been
stated earlier, Euclid was the first to
organize these propositions into a
logical system in which each result is
proved from axioms and previously
proved theorems.
