Assembly language

In computing, assembly language, often
referred to simply as assembly and
commonly abbreviated as ASM or asm, is
any low-level programming language with
a very strong correspondence between
the instructions in the language and
the architecture's machine code
instructions. Assembly language usually
has one statement per machine code
instruction (1:1), but constants,
comments, assembler directives,
symbolic labels of, e.g., memory
locations, registers, and macros are
generally also supported.
