Motherboard

A motherboard, also called a mainboard,
a system board, a logic board, and
informally a mobo, is the main printed
circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose
computers and other expandable systems.
It holds and allows communication
between many of the crucial electronic
components of a system, such as the
central processing unit (CPU) and
memory, and provides connectors for
other peripherals.
