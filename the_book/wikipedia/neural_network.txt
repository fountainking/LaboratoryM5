Neural network

A neural network is a group of
interconnected units called neurons
that send signals to one another.
Neurons can be either biological cells
or signal pathways. While individual
neurons are simple, many of them
together in a network can perform
complex tasks. There are two main types
of neural networks.In neuroscience, a
biological neural network is a physical
structure found in brains and complex
nervous systems a population of nerve
cells connected by synapses. In machine
learning, an artificial neural network
is a mathematical model used to
approximate nonlinear functions.
Artificial neural networks are used to
solve artificial intelligence problems.
