Real number

In mathematics, a real number is a
number that can be used to measure a
continuous one-dimensional quantity
such as a length, duration or
temperature. Here, continuous means
that pairs of values can have
arbitrarily small differences. Every
real number can be almost uniquely
represented by an infinite decimal
expansion.
