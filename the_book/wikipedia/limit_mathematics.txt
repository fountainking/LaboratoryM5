Limit (mathematics)

In mathematics, a limit is the value
that a function approaches as the
argument approaches some value. Limits
of functions are essential to calculus
and mathematical analysis, and are used
to define continuity, derivatives, and
integrals. The concept of a limit of a
sequence is further generalized to the
concept of a limit of a topological
net, and is closely related to limit
and direct limit in category theory.
The limit inferior and limit superior
provide generalizations of the concept
of a limit which are particularly
relevant when the limit at a point may
not exist.
