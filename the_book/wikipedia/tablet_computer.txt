Tablet computer

A tablet computer, commonly shortened
to tablet or simply tab, is a mobile
device, typically with a mobile
operating system and touchscreen
display processing circuitry, and a
rechargeable battery in a single, thin
and flat package. Tablets, being
computers, have similar capabilities,
but lack some input/output (I/O)
abilities that others have. Modern
tablets are based on smartphones, the
only differences being that tablets are
relatively larger than smartphones,
with screens 7 inches (18cm) or larger,
measured diagonally, and may not
support access to a cellular network.
Unlike laptops, tablets usually run
mobile operating systems, alongside
smartphones.
