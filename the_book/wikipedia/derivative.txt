Derivative

In mathematics, the derivative is a
fundamental tool that quantifies the
sensitivity to change of a function's
output with respect to its input. The
derivative of a function of a single
variable at a chosen input value, when
it exists, is the slope of the tangent
line to the graph of the function at
that point. The tangent line is the
best linear approximation of the
function near that input value. The
derivative is often described as the
instantaneous rate of change, the ratio
of the instantaneous change in the
dependent variable to that of the
independent variable. The process of
finding a derivative is called
differentiation.
