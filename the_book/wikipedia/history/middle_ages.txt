Middle Ages

In the history of Europe, the Middle
Ages or medieval period lasted
approximately from the 5th to the late
15th centuries, similarly to the
post-classical period of global
history. It began with the fall of the
Western Roman Empire and transitioned
into the Renaissance and the Age of
Discovery. The Middle Ages is the
middle period of the three traditional
divisions of Western history: classical
antiquity, the medieval period, and the
modern period. The medieval period is
itself subdivided into the Early, High,
and Late Middle Ages.
