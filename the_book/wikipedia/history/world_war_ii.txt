World War II

World War II or the Second World War
was a global conflict between two
coalitions: the Allies and the Axis
powers. Nearly all of the world's
countries participated, with many
nations mobilising all resources in
pursuit of total war. Tanks and
aircraft played major roles, enabling
the strategic bombing of cities and
delivery of the first and only nuclear
weapons ever used in war. World War II
is the deadliest conflict in history,
causing the death of 70 to 85 million
people, more than half of whom were
civilians. Millions died in genocides,
including the Holocaust, and by
massacres, starvation, and disease.
After the Allied victory, Germany,
Austria, Japan, and Korea were
occupied, and German and Japanese
leaders were tried for war crimes.
