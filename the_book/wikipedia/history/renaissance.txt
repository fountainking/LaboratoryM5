Renaissance

The Renaissance is a period of history
and a European cultural movement
covering the 15th and 16th centuries.
It marked the transition from the
Middle Ages to modernity and was
characterized by an effort to revive
and surpass the ideas and achievements
of classical antiquity. Associated with
great social change in most fields and
disciplines, including art,
architecture, politics, literature,
exploration and science, the
Renaissance was first centered in the
Republic of Florence, then spread to
the rest of Italy and later throughout
Europe. The term rinascita ("rebirth")
first appeared in Lives of the Artists
by Giorgio Vasari, while the
corresponding French word renaissance
was adopted into English as the term
for this period during the 1830s.
