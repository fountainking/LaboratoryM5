Mesopotamia

Mesopotamia is a historical region of
West Asia situated within the
Tigris–Euphrates river system, in the
northern part of the Fertile Crescent.
It corresponds roughly to the territory
of modern Iraq and forms the eastern
geographic boundary of the modern
Middle East. Just beyond it lies
southwestern Iran, where the region
transitions into the Persian plateau,
marking the shift from the Arab world
to Iran. In the broader sense, the
historical region of Mesopotamia also
includes parts of present-day Iran
(southwest), Turkey (southeast), Syria
(northeast), and Kuwait.
