American Civil War

The American Civil War was a civil war
in the United States between the Union
and the Confederacy, which was formed
in 1861 by states that had seceded from
the Union to preserve African American
slavery, which they saw as threatened
because of the election of Abraham
Lincoln and the growing abolitionist
movement in the North.
