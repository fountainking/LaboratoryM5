Ancient Greece

Ancient Greece was a northeastern
Mediterranean civilization, existing
from the Greek Dark Ages of the
12th–9th centuries BC to the end of
classical antiquity, that comprised a
loose collection of culturally and
linguistically related city-states and
communities. Prior to the Roman period,
most of these regions were officially
unified only once under the Kingdom of
Macedon from 338 to 323 BC. In Western
history, the era of classical antiquity
was immediately followed by the Early
Middle Ages and the Byzantine period.
