Mineral (nutrient)

In the context of nutrition, a mineral
is a chemical element. Some "minerals"
are essential for life, but most are
not. Minerals are one of the four
groups of essential nutrients; the
others are vitamins, essential fatty
acids, and essential amino acids. The
five major minerals in the human body
are calcium, phosphorus, potassium,
sodium, and magnesium. The remaining
minerals are called "trace elements".
The generally accepted trace elements
are iron, chlorine, cobalt, copper,
zinc, manganese, molybdenum, iodine,
selenium, and bromine; there is some
evidence that there may be more.
