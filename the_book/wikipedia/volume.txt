Volume

Volume is a measure of regions in
three-dimensional space. It is often
quantified numerically using SI derived
units or by various imperial or US
customary units. The definition of
length and height (cubed) is
interrelated with volume. The volume of
a container is generally understood to
be the capacity of the container; i.e.,
the amount of fluid that the container
could hold, rather than the amount of
space the container itself displaces.
By metonymy, the term "volume"
sometimes is used to refer to the
corresponding region.
