Cardiopulmonary resuscitation

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is
an emergency procedure used during
cardiac or respiratory arrest that
involves chest compressions, often
combined with artificial ventilation,
to preserve brain function and maintain
circulation until spontaneous breathing
and heartbeat can be restored. It is
recommended for those who are
unresponsive with no breathing or
abnormal breathing, for example, agonal
respirations.
