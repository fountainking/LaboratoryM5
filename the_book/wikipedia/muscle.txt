Muscle

Muscle is a soft tissue, one of the
four basic types of animal tissue.
There are three types of muscle tissue
in vertebrates: skeletal muscle,
cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle.
Muscle tissue gives skeletal muscles
the ability to contract. Muscle tissue
contains special contractile proteins
called actin and myosin which interact
to cause movement. Among many other
muscle proteins, present are two
regulatory proteins, troponin and
tropomyosin. Muscle is formed during
embryonic development, in a process
known as myogenesis.
