Stem cell

In multicellular organisms, stem cells
are undifferentiated or partially
differentiated cells that can change
into various types of cells and
proliferate indefinitely to produce
more of the same stem cell. They are
the earliest type of cell in a cell
lineage. They are found in both
embryonic and adult organisms, but they
have slightly different properties in
each. They are usually distinguished
from progenitor cells, which cannot
divide indefinitely, and precursor or
blast cells, which are usually
committed to differentiating into one
cell type.
