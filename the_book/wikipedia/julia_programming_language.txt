**JULIA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE**

Julia (programming language)

Julia is a dynamic general-purpose
programming language. As a high-level
language, distinctive aspects of
Julia's design include a type system
with parametric polymorphism, the use
of multiple dispatch as a core
programming paradigm, just-in-time
(JIT) compilation and a parallel
garbage collection implementation.
Notably Julia does not support classes
with encapsulated methods but instead
relies on the types of all of a
function's arguments to determine which
method will be called.
