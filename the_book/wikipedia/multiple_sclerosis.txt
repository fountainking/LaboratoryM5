Multiple sclerosis

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an
autoimmune disease resulting in damage
to myelin which is the insulating
covers of nerve cells in the brain and
spinal cord. As a demyelinating
disease, MS disrupts the nervous
system's ability to transmit signals,
resulting in a range of signs and
symptoms, including physical, mental,
and sometimes psychiatric problems.
Symptoms include double vision, vision
loss, eye pain, muscle weakness, and
loss of sensation or coordination.
