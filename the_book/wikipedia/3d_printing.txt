3D printing

3D printing, also called additive
manufacturing, is the construction of a
three-dimensional object from a CAD
model or a digital 3D model. It can be
done in a variety of processes in which
material is deposited, joined or
solidified under computer control, with
the material being added together,
typically layer by layer.
