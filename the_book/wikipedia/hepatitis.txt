Hepatitis

Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver
tissue. Some people or animals with
hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas
others develop yellow discoloration of
the skin and whites of the eyes
(jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting,
tiredness, abdominal pain, and
diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it
resolves within six months, and chronic
if it lasts longer than six months.
Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own,
progress to chronic hepatitis, or
(rarely) result in acute liver failure.
Chronic hepatitis may progress to
scarring of the liver (cirrhosis),
liver failure, and liver cancer.
