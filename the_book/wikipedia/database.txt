Database

In computing, a database is an
organized collection of data or a type
of data store based on the use of a
database management system (DBMS), the
software that interacts with end users,
applications, and the database itself
to capture and analyze the data. The
DBMS additionally encompasses the core
facilities provided to administer the
database. The sum total of the
database, the DBMS and the associated
applications can be referred to as a
database system. Often the term
"database" is also used loosely to
refer to any of the DBMS, the database
system or an application associated
with the database.
