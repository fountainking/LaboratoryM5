Logarithm

In mathematics, the logarithm of a
number is the exponent by which another
fixed value, the base, must be raised
to produce that number. For example,
the logarithm of 1000 to base 10 is 3,
because 1000 is 10 to the 3rd power:
1000 = 103 = 101010. More generally, if
x = by, then y is the logarithm of x to
base b, written logb x, so log10 1000 =
3. As a single-variable function, the
logarithm to base b is the inverse of
exponentiation with base b.
