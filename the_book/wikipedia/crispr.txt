**CRISPR**

CRISPR is a family of DNA sequences
found in the genomes of prokaryotic
organisms such as bacteria and archaea.
Each sequence within an individual
prokaryotic CRISPR is derived from a
DNA fragment of a bacteriophage that
had previously infected the prokaryote
or one of its ancestors. These
sequences are used to detect and
destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages
during subsequent infections. Hence
these sequences play a key role in the
antiviral defense system of prokaryotes
and provide a form of heritable,
acquired immunity. CRISPR is found in
approximately 50% of sequenced
bacterial genomes and nearly 90% of
sequenced archaea.
