Radio

Radio is the technology of
communicating using radio waves. Radio
waves are electromagnetic waves of
frequency between 3hertz (Hz) and
300gigahertz (GHz). They are generated
by an electronic device called a
transmitter connected to an antenna
which radiates the waves. They can be
received by other antennas connected to
a radio receiver; this is the
fundamental principle of radio
communication. In addition to
communication, radio is used for radar,
radio navigation, remote control,
remote sensing, and other applications.
