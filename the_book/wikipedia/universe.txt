Universe

The universe is all of space and time
and their contents. It comprises all of
existence, any fundamental interaction,
physical process and physical constant,
and therefore all forms of matter and
energy, and the structures they form,
from sub-atomic particles to entire
galactic filaments. Since the early
20th century, the field of cosmology
establishes that space and time emerged
together at the Big Bang
13.7870.020billion years ago and that
the universe has been expanding since
then. The portion of the universe that
can be seen by humans is approximately
93 billion light-years in diameter at
present, but the total size of the
universe is not known.
