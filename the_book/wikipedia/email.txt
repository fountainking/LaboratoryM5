Email

Electronic mail is a method of
transmitting and receiving digital
messages using electronic devices over
a computer network. It was conceived in
the late20th century as the digital
version of, or counterpart to, mail.
Email is a ubiquitous and very widely
used communication medium; in current
use, an email address is often treated
as a basic and necessary part of many
processes in business, commerce,
government, education, entertainment,
and other spheres of daily life in most
countries.
