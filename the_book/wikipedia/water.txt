Water

Water is an inorganic compound with the
chemical formula H2O. It is a
transparent, tasteless, odorless, and
nearly colorless chemical substance. It
is the main constituent of Earth's
hydrosphere and the fluids of all known
living organisms in which it acts as a
solvent. Water, being a polar molecule,
undergoes strong intermolecular
hydrogen bonding which is a large
contributor to its physical and
chemical properties. It is vital for
all known forms of life, despite not
providing food energy or being an
organic micronutrient. Due to its
presence in all organisms, its chemical
stability, its worldwide abundance and
its strong polarity relative to its
small molecular size; water is often
referred to as the "universal solvent".
