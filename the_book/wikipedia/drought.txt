Drought

A drought is a period of
drier-than-normal conditions. A drought
can last for days, months or years.
Drought often has large impacts on the
ecosystems and agriculture of affected
regions, and causes harm to the local
economy. Annual dry seasons in the
tropics significantly increase the
chances of a drought developing, with
subsequent increased wildfire risks.
Heat waves can significantly worsen
drought conditions by increasing
evapotranspiration. This dries out
forests and other vegetation, and
increases the amount of fuel for
wildfires.
