Anxiety

Anxiety is an emotion characterized by
an unpleasant state of inner turmoil
and includes feelings of dread over
anticipated events. Anxiety is
different from fear in that fear is
defined as the emotional response to a
present threat, whereas anxiety is the
anticipation of a future one. It is
often accompanied by nervous behavior
such as pacing back and forth, somatic
complaints, and rumination.
