Nose

A nose is a sensory organ and
respiratory structure in vertebrates.
It consists of a nasal cavity inside
the head, and an external nose on the
face. The external nose houses the
nostrils, or nares, a pair of tubes
providing airflow through the nose for
respiration. Where the nostrils pass
through the nasal cavity they widen,
are known as nasal fossae, and contain
turbinates and olfactory mucosa. The
nasal cavity also connects to the
paranasal sinuses. From the nasal
cavity, the nostrils continue into the
pharynx, a switch track valve
connecting the respiratory and
digestive systems.
