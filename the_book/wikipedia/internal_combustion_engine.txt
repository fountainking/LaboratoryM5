Internal combustion engine

An internal combustion engine is a heat
engine in which the combustion of a
fuel occurs with an oxidizer in a
combustion chamber that is an integral
part of the working fluid flow circuit.
In an internal combustion engine, the
expansion of the high-temperature and
high-pressure gases produced by
combustion applies direct force to
components of the engine. The force is
typically applied to pistons, turbine
blades, a rotor, or a nozzle. This
force moves the component over a
distance. This process transforms
chemical energy into kinetic energy
which is used to propel, move or power
whatever the engine is attached to.
