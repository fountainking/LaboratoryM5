Linear equation

In mathematics, a linear equation is an
equation that may be put in the form
where are the variables, and are the
coefficients, which are often real
numbers. The coefficients may be
considered as parameters of the
equation and may be arbitrary
expressions, provided they do not
contain any of the variables. To yield
a meaningful equation, the coefficients
are required to not all be zero.
