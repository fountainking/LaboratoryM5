Bone

A bone is a rigid organ that
constitutes part of the skeleton in
most vertebrate animals. Bones protect
the organs of the body, produce red and
white blood cells, store minerals, help
regulate acid-base homeostasis, provide
structure and support for the body, and
enable mobility and hearing. Bones come
in a variety of shapes and sizes and
have complex internal and external
structures.
