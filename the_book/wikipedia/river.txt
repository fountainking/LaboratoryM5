**RIVER**

River

A river is a natural stream of fresh
water that flows on land or inside
caves towards another body of water at
a lower elevation, such as an ocean,
lake, or another river. A river may run
dry before reaching the end of its
course if it runs out of water, or only
flow during certain seasons. Rivers are
regulated by the water cycle, the
processes by which water moves around
the Earth. Water first enters rivers
through precipitation, whether from
rainfall, the runoff of water down a
slope, the melting of glaciers or snow,
or seepage from aquifers beneath the
surface of the Earth.
