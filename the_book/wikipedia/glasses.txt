Glasses

Glasses, also known as eyeglasses,
spectacles, or colloquially as specs,
are vision eyewear with clear or tinted
lenses mounted in a frame that holds
them in front of a person's eyes,
typically utilizing a bridge over the
nose and hinged arms, known as temples
or temple pieces, that rest over the
ears for support.
