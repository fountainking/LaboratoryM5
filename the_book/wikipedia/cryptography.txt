Cryptography

Cryptography, or cryptology, is the
practice and study of techniques for
secure communication in the presence of
adversarial behavior. More generally,
cryptography is about constructing and
analyzing protocols that prevent third
parties or the public from reading
private messages. Modern cryptography
exists at the intersection of the
disciplines of mathematics, computer
science, information security,
electrical engineering, digital signal
processing, physics, and others. Core
concepts related to information
security are also central to
cryptography. Practical applications of
cryptography include electronic
commerce, chip-based payment cards,
digital currencies, computer passwords
and military communications.
