Virtual machine

In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is
the virtualization or emulation of a
computer system. Virtual machines are
based on computer architectures and
provide the functionality of a physical
computer. Their implementations may
involve specialized hardware, software,
or a combination of the two. Virtual
machines differ and are organized by
their function, shown here:System
virtual machines provide a substitute
for a real machine. They provide the
functionality needed to execute entire
operating systems. A hypervisor uses
native execution to share and manage
hardware, allowing for multiple
environments that are isolated from one
another yet exist on the same physical
machine. Modern hypervisors use
hardware-assisted virtualization, with
virtualization-specific hardware
features on the host CPUs providing
assistance to hypervisors. Process
virtual machines are designed to
execute computer programs in a
platform-independent environment.
