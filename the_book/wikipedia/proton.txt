Proton

A proton is a stable subatomic
particle, symbol p, H+, or 1H+ with a
positive electric charge of +1e
(elementary charge). Its mass is
slightly less than the mass of a
neutron and approximately 1836 times
the mass of an electron (the
proton-to-electron mass ratio). Protons
and neutrons, each with a mass of
approximately one dalton, are jointly
referred to as nucleons (particles
present in atomic nuclei).
