Pacemaker

A pacemaker, also known as an
artificial cardiac pacemaker, is an
implanted medical device that generates
electrical pulses delivered by
electrodes to one or more of the
chambers of the heart. Each pulse
causes the targeted chamber(s) to
contract and pump blood, thus
regulating the function of the
electrical conduction system of the
heart.
