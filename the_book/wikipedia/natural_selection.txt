Natural selection

Natural selection is the differential
survival and reproduction of
individuals due to differences in the
relative fitness endowed on them by
their own particular complement of
observable characteristics. It is a key
law or mechanism of evolution which
changes the heritable traits
characteristic of a population or
species over generations. Charles
Darwin popularised the term "natural
selection", contrasting it with
artificial selection, which is
intentional, whereas natural selection
is not.
