Electric motor

An electric motor is a machine that
converts electrical energy into
mechanical energy. Most electric motors
operate through the interaction between
the motor's magnetic field and electric
current in a wire winding to generate
Laplace force in the form of torque
applied on the motor's shaft. An
electric generator is mechanically
identical to an electric motor, but
operates in reverse, converting
mechanical energy into electrical
energy.
