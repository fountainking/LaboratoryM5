Technology

Technology is the application of
conceptual knowledge to achieve
practical goals, especially in a
reproducible way. The word technology
can also mean the products resulting
from such efforts, including both
tangible tools such as utensils or
machines, and intangible ones such as
software. Technology plays a critical
role in science, engineering, and
everyday life.
