Pascal's triangle

In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is an
infinite triangular array of the
binomial coefficients which play a
crucial role in probability theory,
combinatorics, and algebra. In much of
the Western world, it is named after
the French mathematician Blaise Pascal,
although other mathematicians studied
it centuries before him in Persia,
India, China, Germany, and Italy.
