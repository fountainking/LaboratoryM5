Cholera

Cholera is an infection of the small
intestine by some strains of the
bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Symptoms may
range from none, to mild, to severe.
The classic symptom is large amounts of
watery diarrhea lasting a few days.
Vomiting and muscle cramps may also
occur. Diarrhea can be so severe that
it leads within hours to severe
dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
This can in turn result in sunken eyes,
cold or cyanotic skin, decreased skin
elasticity, wrinkling of the hands and
feet, and, in severe cases, death.
Symptoms start two hours to five days
after exposure.
