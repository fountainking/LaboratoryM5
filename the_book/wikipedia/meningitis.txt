Meningitis

Meningitis is acute or chronic
inflammation of the protective
membranes covering the brain and spinal
cord, collectively called the meninges.
The most common symptoms are fever,
intense headache, vomiting and neck
stiffness and occasionally photophobia.
Other symptoms include confusion or
altered consciousness, nausea, and an
inability to tolerate loud noises.
Young children often exhibit only
nonspecific symptoms, such as
irritability, drowsiness, or poor
feeding. A non-blanching rash may also
be present.
