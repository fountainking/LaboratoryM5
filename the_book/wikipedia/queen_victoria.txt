Queen Victoria

Victoria was Queen of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
from 20 June 1837 until her death. Her
reign of 63 years and 216 days, which
was longer than those of any of her
predecessors, constituted the Victorian
era. It was a period of industrial,
political, scientific, and military
change within the United Kingdom, and
was marked by a great expansion of the
British Empire. In 1876, the British
parliament voted to grant her the
additional title of Empress of India.
