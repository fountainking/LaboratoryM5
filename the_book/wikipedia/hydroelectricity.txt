Hydroelectricity

Hydroelectricity, or hydroelectric
power, is electricity generated from
hydropower. Hydropower supplies 15% of
the world's electricity, almost 4,210
TWh in 2023, which is more than all
other renewable sources combined and
also more than nuclear power.
Hydropower can provide large amounts of
low-carbon electricity on demand,
making it a key element for creating
secure and clean electricity supply
systems. A hydroelectric power station
that has a dam and reservoir is a
flexible source, since the amount of
electricity produced can be increased
or decreased in seconds or minutes in
response to varying electricity demand.
Once a hydroelectric complex is
constructed, it produces no direct
waste, and almost always emits
considerably less greenhouse gas than
fossil fuel-powered energy plants.
However, when constructed in lowland
rainforest areas, where part of the
forest is inundated, substantial
amounts of greenhouse gases may be
emitted.
