Tornado

A tornado is a rotating column of air
that is in contact with the surface of
Earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in
rare cases, the base of a cumulus
cloud. It is often referred to as a
twister, whirlwind or cyclone, although
the word cyclone is used in meteorology
to name a weather system with a
low-pressure area in the center around
which, from an observer looking down
toward the surface of the Earth, winds
blow counterclockwise in the Northern
Hemisphere and clockwise in the
Southern Hemisphere. Tornadoes come in
many shapes and sizes, and they are
often visible in the form of a
condensation funnel originating from
the base of a cumulonimbus cloud, with
a cloud of rotating debris and dust
beneath it. Most tornadoes have wind
speeds less than 180 kilometers per
hour, are about 80 meters across, and
travel several kilometers before
dissipating. The most extreme tornadoes
can attain wind speeds of more than 480
kilometers per hour (300mph), can be
more than 3 kilometers (2mi) in
diameter, and can stay on the ground
for more than 100km (62mi).
