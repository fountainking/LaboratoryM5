Invention

An invention is a unique or novel
device, method, composition, idea, or
process. An invention may be an
improvement upon a machine, product, or
process for increasing efficiency or
lowering cost. It may also be an
entirely new concept. If an idea is
unique enough either as a stand-alone
invention or as a significant
improvement over the work of others, it
can be patented. A patent, if granted,
gives the inventor a proprietary
interest in the patent over a specific
period of time, which can be licensed
for financial gain.
