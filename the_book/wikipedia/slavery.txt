Slavery

Slavery is the ownership of a person as

phenomenon and its history resides in
economic history. Slavery typically
involves compulsory work, with the
slave's location of work and residence
dictated by the party that holds them
in bondage. Enslavement is the
placement of a person into slavery, and
the person is called a slave or an
enslaved person.
