Angle

In geometry, an angle is formed by two
lines that meet at a point. Each line
is called a side of the angle, and the
point they share is called the vertex
of the angle. The term angle is used to
denote both geometric figures and their
size or magnitude. Angular measure or
measure of angle are sometimes used to
distinguish between the measurement and
figure itself. The measurement of
angles is intrinsically linked with
circles and rotation, and this is often
visualized or defined using the arc of
a circle centered at the vertex and
lying between the sides.
