Geology

Geology is a branch of natural science
concerned with the Earth and other
astronomical bodies, the rocks of which
they are composed, and the processes by
which they change over time. The name
comes from Ancient Greek (g)'earth' and
o (-loga)'study of, discourse'. Modern
geology significantly overlaps all
other Earth sciences, including
hydrology. It is integrated with Earth
system science and planetary science.
