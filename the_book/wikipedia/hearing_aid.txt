Hearing aid

A hearing aid is a device designed to
improve hearing by making sound audible
to a person with hearing loss. Hearing
aids are classified as medical devices
in most countries, and regulated by the
respective regulations. Small audio
amplifiers such as personal sound
amplification products (PSAPs) or other
plain sound reinforcing systems cannot
be sold as "hearing aids".
