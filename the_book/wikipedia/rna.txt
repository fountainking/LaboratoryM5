RNA

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric
molecule that is essential for most
biological functions, either by
performing the function itself or by
forming a template for the production
of proteins. RNA and deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) are nucleic acids. The
nucleic acids constitute one of the
four major macromolecules essential for
all known forms of life. RNA is
assembled as a chain of nucleotides.
Cellular organisms use messenger RNA
(mRNA) to convey genetic information
that directs synthesis of specific
proteins. Many viruses encode their
genetic information using an RNA
genome.
