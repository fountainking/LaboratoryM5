Crusades

The Crusades were a series of military
campaigns launched by the papacy
between 1095 and 1699 against the
perceived enemies of Christendom,
encouraged by promises of spiritual
reward. The First Crusade was
proclaimed by Pope Urban II at the
Council of Clermont on 27November 1095
in response to a Byzantine appeal for
aid against the advancing Seljuk Turks.
By this time, the papacy's position as
head of the Catholic Church had
strengthened, and earlier conflicts
with secular rulers and wars on Western
Christendom's frontiers had prepared it
for the direction of armed force in
religious causes. The First Crusade led
to the creation of four Crusader states
in the Middle East, whose defence
required further expeditions from
Catholic Europe. The organisation of
such large-scale campaigns demanded
complex religious, social, and economic
institutions, including crusade
indulgences, military orders, and the
taxation of clerical income. Over time,
the crusading movement expanded to
include campaigns against pagans,
Christian dissidents, and other enemies
of the papacy, promoted with similar
spiritual rewards and continuing into
the 18thcentury.
