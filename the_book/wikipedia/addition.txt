**ADDITION**

---------------------------------------

Addition

Addition, usually denoted with the plus
sign +, is one of the four basic
operations of arithmetic, the other
three being subtraction,
multiplication, and division. The
addition of two whole numbers results
in the total or sum of those values
combined. For example, the adjacent
image shows two columns of apples, one
with three apples and the other with
two apples, totaling to five apples.
This observation is expressed as "3 + 2
= 5", which is read as "three plus two
equals five".
