Star

A star is a luminous spheroid of plasma
held together by self-gravity. The
nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many
other stars are visible to the naked
eye at night; their immense distances
from Earth make them appear as fixed
points of light. The most prominent
stars have been categorised into
constellations and asterisms, and many
of the brightest stars have proper
names. Astronomers have assembled star
catalogues that identify the known
stars and provide standardized stellar
designations. The observable universe
contains an estimated 1022 to 1024
stars. Only about 4,000 of these stars
are visible to the naked eyeall within
the Milky Way galaxy.
