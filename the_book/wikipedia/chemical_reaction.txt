Chemical reaction

A chemical reaction is a process that
leads to the chemical transformation of
one set of chemical substances to
another. When chemical reactions occur,
the atoms are rearranged and the
reaction is accompanied by an energy
change as new products are generated.
Classically, chemical reactions
encompass changes that only involve the
positions of electrons in the forming
and breaking of chemical bonds between
atoms, with no change to the nuclei,
and can often be described by a
chemical equation. Nuclear chemistry is
a sub-discipline of chemistry that
involves the chemical reactions of
unstable and radioactive elements where
both electronic and nuclear changes can
occur.
