Dehydration

In physiology, dehydration is a lack of
total body water that disrupts
metabolic processes. It occurs when
free water loss exceeds intake, often
resulting from excessive sweating,
health conditions, or inadequate
consumption of water. Mild dehydration
can also be caused by immersion
diuresis, which may increase risk of
decompression sickness in divers.
