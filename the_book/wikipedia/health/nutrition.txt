Nutrition

Nutrition is the biochemical and
physiological process by which an
organism uses food and water to support
its life. The intake of these
substances provides organisms with
nutrients which can be metabolized to
create energy and chemical structures;
too much or too little of an essential
nutrient can cause malnutrition.
Nutritional science, the study of
nutrition as a hard science, typically
emphasizes human nutrition.
