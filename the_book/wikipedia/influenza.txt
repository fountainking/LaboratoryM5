Influenza

Influenza, commonly known as the flu,
is an infectious disease caused by
influenza viruses. Symptoms range from
mild to severe and often include fever,
runny nose, sore throat, muscle pain,
headache, coughing, and fatigue. These
symptoms begin one to four days after
exposure to the virus and last for
about two to eight days. Diarrhea and
vomiting can occur, particularly in
children. Influenza may progress to
pneumonia from the virus or a
subsequent bacterial infection. Other
complications include acute respiratory
distress syndrome, meningitis,
encephalitis, and worsening of
pre-existing health problems such as
asthma and cardiovascular disease.
