Java (programming language)

Java is a high-level, general-purpose,
memory-safe, object-oriented
programming language. It is intended to
let programmers write once, run
anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled
Java code can run on all platforms that
support Java without the need to
recompile. Java applications are
typically compiled to bytecode that can
run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
regardless of the underlying computer
architecture. The syntax of Java is
similar to C and C++, but has fewer
low-level facilities than either of
them. The Java runtime provides dynamic
capabilities that are typically not
available in traditional compiled
languages.
