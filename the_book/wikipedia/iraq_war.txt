Iraq War

The Iraq War, also referred to as the
Second Gulf War, was a prolonged
conflict in Iraq from 2003 to 2011. It
began with the invasion by a United
States-led coalition, which resulted in
the overthrow of the Ba'athist
government of Saddam Hussein. The
conflict persisted as an insurgency
that arose against coalition forces and
the newly established Iraqi government.
US forces were officially withdrawn in
2011. In 2014, the US became re-engaged
in Iraq, leading a new coalition under
Combined Joint Task Force Operation
Inherent Resolve, as the conflict
evolved into the ongoing Islamic State
insurgency.
