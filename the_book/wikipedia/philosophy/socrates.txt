Socrates

Socrates was an ancient Greek
philosopher from Athens who is credited
as the founder of Western philosophy
and as among the first moral
philosophers of the ethical tradition
of thought. An enigmatic figure,
Socrates authored no texts and is known
mainly through the posthumous accounts
of classical writers, particularly his
students Plato and Xenophon. These
accounts are written as dialogues, in
which Socrates and his interlocutors
examine a subject in the style of
question and answer; they gave rise to
the Socratic dialogue literary genre.
Contradictory accounts of Socrates make
a reconstruction of his philosophy
nearly impossible, a situation known as
the Socratic problem. Socrates was a
polarizing figure in Athenian society.
In 399 BC, he was accused of impiety
and corrupting the youth. After a trial
that lasted a day, he was sentenced to
death. He spent his last day in prison,
refusing offers to help him escape.
