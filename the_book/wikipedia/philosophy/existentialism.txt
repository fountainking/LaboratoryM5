Existentialism

Existentialism is a family of
philosophical views and inquiry that
explore the human individual's struggle
to lead an authentic life despite the
apparent absurdity or
incomprehensibility of existence. In
examining meaning, purpose, and value,
existentialist thought often includes
concepts such as existential crises,
angst, courage, and freedom.
