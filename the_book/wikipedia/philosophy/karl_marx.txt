Karl Marx

Karl Marx was a German philosopher,
political theorist, economist,
journalist, and revolutionary
socialist. He is best-known for the
1848 pamphlet The Communist Manifesto,
and his three-volume Das Kapital
(1867–1894), a critique of classical
political economy which employs his
theory of historical materialism in an
analysis of capitalism, in the
culmination of his life's work. Marx's
ideas and their subsequent development,
collectively known as Marxism, have had
enormous influence.
