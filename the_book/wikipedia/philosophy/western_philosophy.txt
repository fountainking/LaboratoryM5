Western philosophy

Western philosophy refers to the
philosophical thought, traditions, and
works of the Western world.
Historically, the term refers to the
philosophical thinking of Western
culture, beginning with the ancient
Greek philosophy of the pre-Socratics.
The word philosophy itself originated
from the Ancient Greek φιλοσοφία,
literally, 'the love of wisdom', from
Ancient Greek: φιλεῖν, 'to love', and
σοφία (sophía), 'wisdom'.
