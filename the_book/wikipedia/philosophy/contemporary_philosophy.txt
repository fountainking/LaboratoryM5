Contemporary philosophy

Contemporary philosophy is the present
period in the history of Western
philosophy beginning in the early 20th
century with the increasing
professionalization of the discipline
and the rise of analytic and
continental philosophy. The phrase is
often confused with modern philosophy,
postmodern philosophy, and with a
non-technical use of the phrase
referring to any recent philosophic
work.
