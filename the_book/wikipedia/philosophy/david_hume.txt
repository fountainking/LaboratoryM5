David Hume

David Hume was a Scottish philosopher,
historian, economist and essayist who
is known for his highly influential
system of empiricism, philosophical
scepticism and metaphysical naturalism.
Beginning with A Treatise of Human
Nature (1739–40), Hume strove to create
a naturalistic science of man that
examined the psychological basis of
human nature. Hume followed John Locke
in rejecting the existence of innate
ideas, concluding that all human
knowledge derives solely from
experience; this places him amongst
such empiricists as Francis Bacon,
Thomas Hobbes, Locke and George
Berkeley.
