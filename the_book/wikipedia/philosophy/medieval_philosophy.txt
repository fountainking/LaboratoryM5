Medieval philosophy

Medieval philosophy is the philosophy
that existed through the Middle Ages,
the period roughly extending from the
fall of the Western Roman Empire in the
5th century until after the Renaissance
in the 13th and 14th centuries.
Medieval philosophy, understood as a
project of independent philosophical
inquiry, began in Baghdad, in the
middle of the 8th century, and in
France and Germany, in the itinerant
court of Charlemagne in Aachen, in the
last quarter of the 8th century. It is
defined partly by the process of
rediscovering the ancient culture
developed in Greece and Rome during the
Classical period, and partly by the
need to address theological problems
and to integrate sacred doctrine with
secular learning. This is one of the
defining characteristics in this time
period. Understanding God was the focal
point of study of the Jewish, Christian
and Muslim Philosophers and
Theologians.
