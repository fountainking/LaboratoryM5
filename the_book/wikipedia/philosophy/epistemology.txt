Epistemology



Epistemology is the branch of
philosophy that examines the nature,
origin, and limits of knowledge. Also
called the theory of knowledge, it
explores different types of knowledge,
such as propositional knowledge about
facts, practical knowledge in the form
of skills, and knowledge by
acquaintance as a familiarity through
experience. Epistemologists study the
concepts of belief, truth, and
justification to understand the nature
of knowledge. To discover how knowledge
arises, they investigate sources of
justification, such as perception,
introspection, memory, reason, and
testimony.
