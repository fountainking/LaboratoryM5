Stoicism

Stoicism is a Hellenistic philosophy
that flourished in ancient Greece and
Rome. The Stoics believed that the
universe operated according to reason,
i.e. by a God which is immersed in
nature itself. Of all the schools of
ancient philosophy, Stoicism made the
greatest claim to being utterly
systematic.
