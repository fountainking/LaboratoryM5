Nihilism

Nihilism is a family of philosophical
views arguing that life is meaningless,
that moral values are baseless, or that
knowledge is impossible. Thus, such
views reject the basis of certain
ideas. Nihilistic views span several
branches of philosophy, including
ethics, value theory, epistemology, and
metaphysics. Nihilism is also described
as a broad cultural phenomenon or
historical movement that pervades
modernity in the Western world.
