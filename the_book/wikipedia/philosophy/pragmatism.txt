Pragmatism

Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition
that views language and thought as
tools for prediction, problem solving,
and action, rather than describing,
representing, or mirroring reality.
Pragmatists contend that most
philosophical topics—such as the nature
of knowledge, language, concepts,
meaning, belief, and science—are best
viewed in terms of their practical uses
and successes.
