Metaphysics

Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy
that examines the basic structure of
reality. It is traditionally seen as
the study of mind-independent features
of the world, but some theorists view
it as an inquiry into the conceptual
framework of human understanding. Some
philosophers, including Aristotle,
designate metaphysics as first
philosophy to suggest that it is more
fundamental than other forms of
philosophical inquiry.
