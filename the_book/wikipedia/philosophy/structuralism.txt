Structuralism

Structuralism is an intellectual
current and methodological approach,
primarily in the social sciences, that
interprets elements of human culture by
way of their relationship to a broader
system. It works to uncover the
structural patterns that underlie all
things that humans do, think, perceive,
and feel.
