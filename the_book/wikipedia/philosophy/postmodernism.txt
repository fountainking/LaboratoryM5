Postmodernism

Postmodernism encompasses a variety of
artistic, cultural, and philosophical
movements. It emerged in the mid-20th
century as a skeptical response to
modernism, emphasizing the instability
of meaning, rejection of universal
truths, and critique of grand
narratives. While its definition varies
across disciplines, it commonly
involves skepticism toward established
norms, blending of styles, and
attention to the socially constructed
nature of knowledge and reality.
