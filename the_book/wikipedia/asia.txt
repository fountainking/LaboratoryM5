Asia is the largest continent in the
world by both land area and population.
It covers an area of more than 44
million square kilometres, about 30% of
Earth's total land area and 8% of
Earth's total surface area. The
continent, which has long been home to
the majority of the human population,
was the site of many of the first
civilisations. Its 4.7billion people
constitute roughly 60% of the world's
