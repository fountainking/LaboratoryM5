Lens

A lens is a transmissive optical device
that focuses or disperses a light beam
by means of refraction. A simple lens
consists of a single piece of
transparent material, while a compound
lens consists of several simple lenses
(elements), usually arranged along a
common axis. Lenses are made from
materials such as glass or plastic and
are ground, polished, or molded to the
required shape. A lens can focus light
to form an image, unlike a prism, which
refracts light without focusing.
Devices that similarly focus or
disperse waves and radiation other than
visible light are also called "lenses",
such as microwave lenses, electron
lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive
lenses.
