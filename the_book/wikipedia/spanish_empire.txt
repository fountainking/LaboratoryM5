Spanish Empire

The Spanish Empire, sometimes referred
to as the Hispanic Monarchy or the
Catholic Monarchy, was a colonial
empire that existed between 1492 and
1976. In conjunction with the
Portuguese Empire, it ushered in the
European Age of Discovery. It achieved
a global scale, controlling vast
portions of the Americas, Africa,
various islands in Asia and Oceania, as
well as territory in other parts of
Europe. It was one of the most powerful
empires of the early modern period,
becoming known as "the empire on which
the sun never sets". At its greatest
extent in the late 1700s and early
1800s, the Spanish Empire covered
13.7million square kilometres, making
it one of the largest empires in
history.
