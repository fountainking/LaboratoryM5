Encryption

In cryptography, encryption is the
process of transforming information in
a way that, ideally, only authorized
parties can decode. This process
converts the original representation of
the information, known as plaintext,
into an alternative form known as
ciphertext. Despite its goal,
encryption does not itself prevent
interference but denies the
intelligible content to a would-be
interceptor.
