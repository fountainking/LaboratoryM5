Dalai Lama

The Dalai Lama is the head of the Gelug
school of Tibetan Buddhism. The term is
part of the full title "Holiness
Knowing Everything Vajradhara Dalai
Lama" given by Altan Khan, the first
Shunyi King of Ming China. He offered
it in appreciation to the Gelug
school's then-leader, Sonam Gyatso, who
received it in 1578 at Yanghua
Monastery. At that time, Sonam Gyatso
had just given teachings to the Khan,
and so the title of Dalai Lama was also
given to the entire tulku lineage.
Sonam Gyatso became the 3rd Dalai Lama,
while the first two tulkus in the
lineage, the 1st Dalai Lama and the 2nd
Dalai Lama, were posthumously awarded
the title.
