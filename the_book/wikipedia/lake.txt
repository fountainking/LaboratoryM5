Lake

A lake is often a naturally occurring,
relatively large and fixed body of
water on or near the Earth's surface.
It is localized in a basin or
interconnected basins surrounded by dry
land. Lakes lie completely on land and
are separate from the ocean, although
they may be connected with the ocean by
rivers. Lakes, as with other bodies of
water, are part of the water cycle, the
processes by which water moves around
the Earth. Most lakes are fresh water
and account for almost all the world's
surface freshwater, but some are salt
lakes with salinities even higher than
that of seawater. Lakes vary
significantly in surface area and
volume of water.
