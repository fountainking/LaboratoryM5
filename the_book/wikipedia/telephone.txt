Telephone

A telephone, commonly shortened to
phone, is a telecommunications device
that enables two or more users to
conduct a conversation when they are
too far apart to be easily heard
directly. A telephone converts sound,
typically and most efficiently the
human voice, into electronic signals
that are transmitted via cables and
other communication channels to another
telephone which reproduces the sound to
the receiving user. The term is derived
from Ancient Greek: , romanized:tle,
lit.'far' and , together meaning
distant voice.
