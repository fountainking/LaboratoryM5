Chickenpox

Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is
a highly contagious disease caused by
varicella zoster virus (VZV), a member
of the herpesvirus family. The disease
results in a characteristic skin rash
that forms small, itchy blisters, which
eventually scab over. It usually starts
on the chest, back, and face. It then
spreads to the rest of the body. The
rash and other symptoms, such as fever,
tiredness, and headaches, usually last
five to seven days. Complications may
occasionally include pneumonia,
inflammation of the brain, and
bacterial skin infections. The disease
is usually more severe in adults than
in children.
