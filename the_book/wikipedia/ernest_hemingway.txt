Ernest Hemingway

Ernest Miller Hemingway ; July 21, 1899
July 2, 1961) was an American novelist,
short-story writer and journalist.
Known for an economical, understated
style that influenced later
20th-century writers, he has been
romanticized for his adventurous
lifestyle and outspoken, blunt public
image. Some of his seven novels, six
short-story collections and two
non-fiction works have become classics
of American literature, and he was
awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in
Literature.
