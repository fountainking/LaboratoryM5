Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is a mental disorder
characterized variously by
hallucinations, delusions, disorganized
thinking or behavior, and flat or
inappropriate affect. Symptoms develop
gradually and typically begin during
young adulthood and rarely resolve.
There is no objective diagnostic test;
diagnosis is based on observed
behavior, a psychiatric history that
includes the person's reported
experiences, and reports of others
familiar with the person. For a formal
diagnosis, the described symptoms need
to have been present for at least six
months or one month. Many people with
schizophrenia have other mental
disorders, especially mood, anxiety,
and substance use disorders, as well as
obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD).
