Bluetooth

Bluetooth is a short-range wireless
technology standard that is used for
exchanging data between fixed and
mobile devices over short distances and
building personal area networks (PANs).
In the most widely used mode,
transmission power is limited to 2.5
milliwatts, giving it a very short
range of up to 10 metres (33ft). It
employs UHF radio waves in the ISM
bands, from 2.402GHz to 2.48GHz. It is
mainly used as an alternative to wired
connections to exchange files between
nearby portable devices and connect
cell phones and music players with
wireless headphones, wireless speakers,
HIFI systems, car audio and wireless
transmission between TVs and soundbars.
