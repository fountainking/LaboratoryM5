**GREENHOUSE EFFECT**

Greenhouse effect

The greenhouse effect occurs when
heat-trapping gases in a planet's
atmosphere prevent the planet from
losing heat to space, raising its
surface temperature. Surface heating
can happen from an internal heat source
or come from an external source, such
as a host star. In the case of Earth,
the Sun emits shortwave radiation
(sunlight) that passes through
greenhouse gases to heat the Earth's
surface. In response, the Earth's
surface emits longwave radiation that
is mostly absorbed by greenhouse gases,
reducing the rate at which the Earth
can cool off.
