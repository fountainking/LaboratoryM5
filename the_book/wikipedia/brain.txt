Brain

The brain is an organ that serves as
the center of the nervous system in all
vertebrate and most invertebrate
animals. It consists of nervous tissue
and is typically located in the head
(cephalization), usually near organs
for special senses such as vision,
hearing, and olfaction. Being the most
specialized organ, it is responsible
for receiving information from the
sensory nervous system, processing that
information and the coordination of
motor control.
