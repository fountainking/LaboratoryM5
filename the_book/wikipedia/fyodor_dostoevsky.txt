Fyodor Dostoevsky

Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky was a
Russian novelist, short story writer,
essayist and journalist. He is regarded
as one of the greatest novelists in
both Russian and world literature, and
many of his works are considered highly
influential masterpieces. Dostoevsky's
literary works explore the human
condition in the troubled political,
social and spiritual atmospheres of
19th-century Russia, and engage with a
variety of philosophical and religious
themes. His most acclaimed novels
include Crime and Punishment (1866),
The Idiot (1869), Demons (1872), The
Adolescent (1875) and The Brothers
Karamazov (1880). His Notes from
Underground, a novella published in
1864, is considered one of the first
works of existentialist literature.
