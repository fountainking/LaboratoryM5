Europe

Europe is a continent located entirely
in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly
in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is
bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the
north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west,
the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and
Asia to the east. Europe shares the
landmass of Eurasia with Asia, and of
Afro-Eurasia with both Africa and Asia.
Europe is commonly considered to be
separated from Asia by the watershed of
the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the
Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the
Black Sea, and the Turkish straits.
