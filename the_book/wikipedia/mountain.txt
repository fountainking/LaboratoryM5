Mountain

A mountain is an elevated portion of
the Earth's crust, generally with steep
sides that show significant exposed
bedrock. Although definitions vary, a
mountain may differ from a plateau in
having a limited summit area, and is
usually higher than a hill, typically
rising at least 600 metres (2,000ft)
above the surrounding land. A few
mountains are isolated summits, but
most occur in mountain ranges.
