September 11 attacks

The September 11 attacks, also known as
9/11, were four coordinated Islamist
terrorist suicide attacks by al-Qaeda
against the United States in 2001.
Nineteen terrorists hijacked four
commercial airliners, two of which were
flown into the Twin Towers of the World
Trade Center in New York City and the
third into the Pentagon, which is the
headquarters of the U.S. Department of
Defense, in Arlington County, Virginia.
The fourth plane crashed in a rural
Pennsylvania field during a passenger
revolt, where the Flight 93 National
Memorial was established. In response
to the attacks, the United States waged
the global war on terror over decades,
to eliminate hostile groups deemed
terrorist organizations, and the
governments purported to support them.
