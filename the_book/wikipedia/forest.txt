Forest

A forest is an ecosystem characterized
by a dense community of trees. Hundreds
of definitions of forest are used
throughout the world, incorporating
factors such as tree density, tree
height, land use, legal standing, and
ecological function. The United
Nations' Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) defines a forest as,
"Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares
with trees higher than 5 meters and a
canopy cover of more than 10 percent,
or trees able to reach these thresholds
in situ. It does not include land that
is predominantly under agricultural or
urban use." Using this definition,
Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020
found that forests covered 4.06billion
hectares, or approximately 31 percent
of the world's land area in 2020.
