Climate change

Present-day climate change includes
both global warmingthe ongoing increase
in global average temperatureand its
wider effects on Earth's climate
system. Climate change in a broader
sense also includes previous long-term
changes to Earth's climate. The current
rise in global temperatures is driven
by human activities, especially fossil
fuel burning since the Industrial
Revolution. Fossil fuel use,
deforestation, and some agricultural
and industrial practices release
greenhouse gases. These gases absorb
some of the heat that the Earth
radiates after it warms from sunlight,
warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon
dioxide, the primary gas driving global
warming, has increased in concentration
by about 50% since the pre-industrial
era to levels not seen for millions of
years.
