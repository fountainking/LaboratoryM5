Hypertension

Hypertension, also known as high blood
pressure, is a long-term medical
condition in which the blood pressure
in the arteries is persistently
elevated. High blood pressure usually
does not cause symptoms itself. It is,
however, a major risk factor for
stroke, coronary artery disease, heart
failure, atrial fibrillation,
peripheral arterial disease, vision
loss, chronic kidney disease, and
dementia. Hypertension is a major cause
of premature death worldwide.
