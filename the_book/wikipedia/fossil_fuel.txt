**FOSSIL FUEL**

---------------------------------------

Fossil fuel

A fossil fuel is a flammable carbon
compound- or hydrocarbon-containing
material formed naturally in the
Earth's crust from the buried remains
of prehistoric organisms, a process
that occurs within geological
formations. Reservoirs of such compound
mixtures, such as coal, petroleum and
natural gas, can be extracted and burnt
as fuel for human consumption to
provide energy for direct use, to power
heat engines that can propel vehicles,
or to generate electricity via steam
turbine generators. Some fossil fuels
are further refined into derivatives
such as kerosene, gasoline and diesel,
or converted into petrochemicals such
as polyolefins (plastics), aromatics
and synthetic resins.
