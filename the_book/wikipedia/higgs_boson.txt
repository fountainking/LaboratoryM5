Higgs boson

The Higgs boson, sometimes called the
Higgs particle, is an elementary
particle in the Standard Model of
particle physics produced by the
quantum excitation of the Higgs field,
one of the fields in particle physics
theory. In the Standard Model, the
Higgs particle is a massive scalar
boson that couples to particles whose
mass arises from their interactions
with the Higgs Field, has zero spin,
even (positive) parity, no electric
charge, and no colour charge. It is
also very unstable, decaying into other
particles almost immediately upon
generation.
