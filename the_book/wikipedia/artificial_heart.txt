Artificial heart

An artificial heart is a device that
replaces the heart. Artificial hearts
are typically used as a bridge to heart
transplantation, but ongoing research
aims to develop a device that could
permanently replace the heart when a
transplantwhether from a deceased human
or, experimentally, from a genetically
engineered pigis unavailable or not
viable. As of December2023, there are
two commercially available full
artificial heart devices; both are
intended for temporary use for patients
with total heart failure who are
awaiting a human heart transplant.
