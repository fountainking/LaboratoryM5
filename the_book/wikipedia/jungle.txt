Jungle

A jungle is land covered with dense
forest and tangled vegetation, usually
in tropical climates. Application of
the term has varied greatly during the
past century. Because jungles occur on
all inhabited landmasses and may
incorporate numerous vegetation and
land types in different climatic zones,
the wildlife of jungles cannot be
straightforwardly defined.
