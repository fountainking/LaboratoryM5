Tropical cyclone

A tropical cyclone is a rapidly
rotating storm system with a
low-pressure area, a closed low-level
atmospheric circulation, strong winds,
and a spiral arrangement of
thunderstorms that produce heavy rain
and squalls. Depending on its location
and strength, a tropical cyclone is
called a hurricane, typhoon, tropical
storm, cyclonic storm, tropical
depression, or simply cyclone. A
hurricane is a strong tropical cyclone
that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean or
northeastern Pacific Ocean. A typhoon
is the same thing which occurs in the
northwestern Pacific Ocean. In the
Indian Ocean and South Pacific,
comparable storms are referred to as
"tropical cyclones". In modern times,
on average around 80 to 90 named
tropical cyclones form each year around
the world, over half of which develop
hurricane-force winds of 65kn or more.
