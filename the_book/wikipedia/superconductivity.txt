Superconductivity

Superconductivity is a set of physical
properties observed in superconductors:
materials where electrical resistance
vanishes and magnetic fields are
expelled from the material. Unlike an
ordinary metallic conductor, whose
resistance decreases gradually as its
temperature is lowered, even down to
near absolute zero, a superconductor
has a characteristic critical
temperature below which the resistance
drops abruptly to zero. An electric
current through a loop of
superconducting wire can persist
indefinitely with no power source.
