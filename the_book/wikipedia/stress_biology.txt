Stress (biology)

Stress, whether physiological,
biological or psychological, is an
organism's response to a stressor, such
as an environmental condition or change
in life circumstances. When stressed by
stimuli that alter an organism's
environment, multiple systems respond
across the body. In humans and most
mammals, the autonomic nervous system
and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis are the two major systems
that respond to stress. Two well-known
hormones that humans produce during
stressful situations are adrenaline and
cortisol.
