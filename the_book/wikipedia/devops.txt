DevOps

DevOps is the integration and
automation of the software development
and information technology operations.
DevOps encompasses necessary tasks of
software development and can lead to
shortening development time and
improving the development life cycle.
According to Neal Ford, DevOps,
particularly through continuous
delivery, employs the "Bring the pain
forward" principle, tackling tough
tasks early, fostering automation and
swift issue detection. Software
programmers and architects should use
fitness functions to keep their
software in check.
