Sphere

A sphere is a surface analogous to the
circle, a curve. In solid geometry, a
sphere is the set of points that are
all at the same distance r from a given
point in three-dimensional space. That
given point is the center of the
sphere, and the distance r is the
sphere's radius. The earliest known
mentions of spheres appear in the work
of the ancient Greek mathematicians.
