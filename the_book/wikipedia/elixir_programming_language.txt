Elixir (programming language)

Elixir is a functional, concurrent,
high-level general-purpose programming
language that runs on the BEAM virtual
machine, which is also used to
implement the Erlang programming
language. Elixir builds on top of
Erlang and shares the same abstractions
for building distributed,
fault-tolerant applications. Elixir
also provides tooling and an extensible
design. The latter is supported by
compile-time metaprogramming with
macros and polymorphism via protocols.
