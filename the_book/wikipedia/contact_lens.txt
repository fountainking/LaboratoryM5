Contact lens

Contact lenses, or simply contacts, are
thin lenses placed directly on the
surface of the eyes. Contact lenses are
ocular prosthetic devices used by over
150 million people worldwide, and they
can be worn to correct vision or for
cosmetic or therapeutic reasons. In
2023, the worldwide market for contact
lenses was estimated at $18.6 billion,
with North America accounting for the
largest share, over 38.18%. Multiple
analysts estimated that the global
market for contact lenses would reach
$33.8 billion by 2030. As of 2010, the
average age of contact lens wearers
globally was 31 years old, and
two-thirds of wearers were female.
