Heart

The heart is a muscular organ found in
humans and other animals. This organ
pumps blood through the blood vessels.
The heart and blood vessels together
make the circulatory system. The pumped
blood carries oxygen and nutrients to
the tissue, while carrying metabolic
waste such as carbon dioxide to the
lungs. In humans, the heart is
approximately the size of a closed fist
and is located between the lungs, in
the middle compartment of the chest,
called the mediastinum.
