Psychology

Psychology is the scientific study of
behavior and mind. Its subject matter
includes the behavior of humans and
nonhumans, both conscious and
unconscious phenomena, and mental
processes such as thoughts, feelings,
and motives. Psychology is an academic
discipline of immense scope, crossing
the boundaries between the natural and
social sciences. Biological
psychologists seek an understanding of
the emergent properties of brains,
linking the discipline to neuroscience.
As social scientists, psychologists aim
to understand the behavior of
individuals and groups.
