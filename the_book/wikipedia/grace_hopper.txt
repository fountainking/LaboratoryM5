Grace Hopper

Grace Brewster Hopper was an American
computer scientist, mathematician, and
United States Navy rear admiral. She
was a pioneer of computer programming.
Hopper was the first to devise the
theory of machine-independent
programming languages, and used this
theory to develop the FLOW-MATIC
programming language and COBOL, an
early high-level programming language
still in use today. She was also one of
the first programmers on the Harvard
Mark I computer. She is credited with
writing the first computer manual, "A
Manual of Operation for the Automatic
Sequence Controlled Calculator."
