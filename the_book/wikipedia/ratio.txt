Ratio

In mathematics, a ratio shows how many
times one number contains another. For
example, if there are eight oranges and
six lemons in a bowl of fruit, then the
ratio of oranges to lemons is eight to
six. Similarly, the ratio of lemons to
oranges is 6:8 and the ratio of oranges
to the total amount of fruit is 8:14.
