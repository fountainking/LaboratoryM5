Savanna

A savanna or savannah is a mixed
woodland-grassland biome and ecosystem
characterised by the trees being
sufficiently widely spaced so that the
canopy does not close. The open canopy
allows sufficient light to reach the
ground to support an unbroken
herbaceous layer consisting primarily
of grasses. Four savanna forms exist;
savanna woodland where trees and shrubs
form a light canopy, tree savanna with
scattered trees and shrubs, shrub
savanna with distributed shrubs, and
grass savanna where trees and shrubs
are mostly nonexistent.
