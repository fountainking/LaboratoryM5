**DESERT**

Desert

A desert is a landscape where little
precipitation occurs and, consequently,
living conditions create unique biomes
and ecosystems. The lack of vegetation
exposes the unprotected surface of the
ground to denudation. About one-third
of the land surface of the Earth is
arid or semi-arid. This includes much
of the polar regions, where little
precipitation occurs, and which are
sometimes called polar deserts or "cold
deserts". Deserts can be classified by
the amount of precipitation that falls,
by the temperature that prevails, by
the causes of desertification or by
their geographical location.
