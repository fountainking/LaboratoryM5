Cryptocurrency

A cryptocurrency is a digital currency
designed to work through a computer
network that is not reliant on any
central authority, such as a government
or bank, to uphold or maintain it.
However, a type of cryptocurrency
called a stablecoin may rely upon
government action or legislation to
require that a stable value be upheld
and maintained.
