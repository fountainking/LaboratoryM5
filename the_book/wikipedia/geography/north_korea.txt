North Korea

North Korea, officially the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), is a
country in East Asia. It constitutes
the northern half of the Korean
Peninsula and borders China and Russia
to the north at the Yalu (Amnok) and
Tumen rivers, and South Korea to the
south at the Korean Demilitarized Zone
(DMZ). The country's western border is
formed by the Yellow Sea, while its
eastern border is defined by the Sea of
Japan. North Korea, like South Korea,
claims to be the sole legitimate
government of the entire peninsula and
adjacent islands. Pyongyang is the
capital and largest city.
