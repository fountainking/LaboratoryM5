Liechtenstein

Liechtenstein, officially the
Principality of Liechtenstein, is a
doubly landlocked country in the
Central European Alps, between Austria
to the east and north-east and
Switzerland to the north-west, west and
south. Liechtenstein is a
semi-constitutional monarchy headed by
the prince of Liechtenstein, currently
Hans-Adam II. It is Europe's
fourth-smallest country, with an area
of just over 160 square kilometres and
a population of 40,023. It is the
world's smallest country to border two
countries, and is one of the few
countries with no debt.
