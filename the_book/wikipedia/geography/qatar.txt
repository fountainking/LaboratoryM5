Qatar

Qatar, officially the State of Qatar,
is a country in West Asia. It occupies
the Qatar Peninsula on the northeastern
coast of the Arabian Peninsula in the
Middle East; it shares its sole land
border with Saudi Arabia to the south,
with the rest of its territory
surrounded by the Persian Gulf. The
Gulf of Bahrain, an inlet of the
Persian Gulf, separates Qatar from
nearby Bahrain. The capital is Doha,
home to over 80% of the country's
inhabitants. Most of the land area is
made up of flat, low-lying desert.
