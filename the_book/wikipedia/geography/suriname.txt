Suriname

Suriname, officially the Republic of
Suriname, is a country in northern

forest cover in the world. Suriname is
bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the
north, French Guiana to the east,
Guyana to the west, and Brazil to the
south. It is the smallest country in
South America by both population and
territory, with around 612,985

approximately 163,820 square
kilometers. The capital and largest
city is Paramaribo, which is home to
roughly half the population.
