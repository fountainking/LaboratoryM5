Mediterranean Sea

The Mediterranean Sea is an
intercontinental sea situated between
Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is
surrounded by the Mediterranean basin
and almost completely enclosed by land:
on the east by the Levant in West Asia,
on the north by Anatolia in West Asia
and Southern Europe, and on the south
by North Africa. To its west it is
connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the
Strait of Gibraltar that separates the
Iberian Peninsula in Europe from
Morocco in Africa by only 14 km (9 mi);
additionally, it is connected to the
Black Sea through the Bosporus strait
that intersects Turkey in the northeast
and the Red Sea via the Suez Canal in
the southeast.
