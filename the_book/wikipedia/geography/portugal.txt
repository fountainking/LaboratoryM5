Portugal

Portugal, officially the Portuguese
Republic, is a country on the Iberian
Peninsula in Southwestern Europe.
Featuring the westernmost point in
continental Europe, Portugal borders
Spain to its north and east, with which
it shares the longest uninterrupted
border in the European Union; to the
south and the west is the North
Atlantic Ocean; and to the west and
southwest lie the Macaronesian
archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira,
which are the two autonomous regions of
Portugal. Lisbon is the capital and
largest city, followed by Porto, which
is the only other metropolitan area.
