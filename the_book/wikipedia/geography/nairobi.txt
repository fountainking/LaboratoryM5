Nairobi

Nairobi is the capital and largest city
of Kenya, located in the south-central
part of the country. As of 2024, it has
a population of 4.8 million and a
metropolitan population of 5.7 million,
making it the 11th most populous city
in Africa. It is the major financial
and economic hub of East Africa,

companies and regional organizations,
including the United Nations Office at
Nairobi. Nicknamed the “Green City in

for being the only capital city in the
world that hosts a national park within
its boundaries, and its name originates
from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nyirobi,
meaning “place of cool waters."
