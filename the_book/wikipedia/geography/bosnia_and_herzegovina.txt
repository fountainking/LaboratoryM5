Bosnia and Herzegovina

Bosnia and Herzegovina, often referred
to as Bosnia-Herzegovina or short as
Bosnia, is a country in Southeast
Europe. Situated on the Balkan
Peninsula, it borders Serbia to the
east, Montenegro to the southeast, and
Croatia to the north and southwest,
with a 20-kilometre-long (12-mile)
coast on the Adriatic Sea in the south.
Bosnia has a moderate continental
climate with hot summers and cold,
snowy winters. Its geography is largely
mountainous, particularly in the
central and eastern regions, which are
dominated by the Dinaric Alps.
Herzegovina, the smaller, southern
region, has a Mediterranean climate and
is mostly mountainous. Sarajevo is the
capital and the largest city.
