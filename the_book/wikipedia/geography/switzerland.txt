Switzerland

Switzerland, officially the Swiss
Confederation, is a landlocked country
located at the intersection of Central,
Western, and Southern Europe. It is
bordered by Germany to the north,
France to the west, Austria and
Liechtenstein to the east, and Italy to
the south. Switzerland is
geographically divided among the Swiss
Alps, the Swiss Plateau, and the Jura
mountains; the Alps cover most of the
country's territory, whereas the
majority of its 9 million people are
concentrated on the plateau, which
hosts many of the largest cities and
economic centres, including Zurich,
Geneva, Basel, Bern, Lausanne,
Winterthur, and Lucerne.
