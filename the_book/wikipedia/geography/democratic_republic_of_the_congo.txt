Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), also known as the DR Congo,
Congo-Kinshasa, or simply Congo, or
more infrequently Zaire is a country in
Central Africa. By land area, it is the
second-largest country in Africa and
the 11th-largest in the world. With a
population of around 112 million, the
DR Congo is the second most populous in
Africa and the most populous nominally
Francophone country in the world.
French is the official and most widely
spoken language, though there are over
200 indigenous languages. The national
capital and largest city is Kinshasa,
which is also the economic center. The
country is bordered by the Republic of
the Congo, the Cabinda exclave of
Angola, and the South Atlantic Ocean to
the west; the Central African Republic
and South Sudan to the north; Uganda,
Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania to the
east; and Zambia and Angola to the
south. Centered on the Congo Basin,
most of the country's terrain is
covered by dense rainforests and is
crossed by many rivers, while the east
and southeast are mountainous.
