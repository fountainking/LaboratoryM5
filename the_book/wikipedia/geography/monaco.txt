Monaco

Monaco, officially the Principality of
Monaco, is a sovereign city-state and
microstate in Western Europe. Situated
on the French Riviera, it is a
semi-enclave bordered by France to the
north, east, and west, with the
Mediterranean Sea to the south; the
Italian region of Liguria is about 15
km (9.3 mi) east. With a population of
38,423 living in an area of 2.08 km2
(0.80 sq mi), Monaco is the second
smallest sovereign state in the world,
after Vatican City, as well as the most
densely populated. It also has the
world's shortest national coastline of
any non-landlocked nation, at 3.83 km
(2.38 mi). Fewer than 10,000 of its
residents are Monégasque nationals.
While the official language of Monaco
is French, Italian and Monégasque are
also widely spoken and understood.
