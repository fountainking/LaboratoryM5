Caribbean Sea

The Caribbean Sea is a sea of the North
Atlantic Ocean in the tropics of the
Western Hemisphere, located south of
the Gulf of Mexico and southwest of the
Sargasso Sea. It is bounded by the
Greater Antilles to the north from Cuba
to Puerto Rico, the Lesser Antilles to
the east from the Virgin Islands to
Trinidad and Tobago, South America to
the south from the Venezuelan coastline
to the Colombian coastline, and Central
America and the Yucatán Peninsula to
the west from Panama to Mexico. The
geopolitical region around the
Caribbean Sea, including the numerous
islands of the West Indies and adjacent
coastal areas in the mainland of the
Americas, is known as the Caribbean.
