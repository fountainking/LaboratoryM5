Argentina

Argentina, officially the Argentine
Republic, is a country in the southern
half of South America. It covers an
area of 2,780,085 km2 (1,073,397 sq
mi), making it the second-largest
country in South America after Brazil,
the fourth-largest country in the
Americas, and the eighth-largest
country in the world. Argentina shares
the bulk of the Southern Cone with
Chile to the west, and is also bordered
by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north,
Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and
the South Atlantic Ocean to the east,
and the Drake Passage to the south.
Argentina is a federal state subdivided
into twenty-three provinces, and one
autonomous city, which is the federal
capital and largest city of the nation,
Buenos Aires. The provinces and the
capital have their own constitutions,
but exist under a federal system.
Argentina claims sovereignty over the
Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the
South Sandwich Islands, the Southern
Patagonian Ice Field, and a part of
Antarctica.
