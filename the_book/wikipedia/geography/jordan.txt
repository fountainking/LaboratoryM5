Jordan

Jordan, officially the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan, is a country in the
Southern Levant region of West Asia.
Jordan is bordered by Syria to the
north, Iraq to the east, Saudi Arabia
to the south, and both Israel and
Palestine to the west. The Jordan
River, flowing into the Dead Sea, is
located along the country's western
border within the Jordan Rift Valley.
Jordan has a small coastline along the
Red Sea in its southwest, separated by
the Gulf of Aqaba from Egypt. Amman is
the country's capital and largest city,
as well as the most populous city in
the Levant.
