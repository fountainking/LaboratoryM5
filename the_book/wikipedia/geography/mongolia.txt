Mongolia

Mongolia is a landlocked country in
East Asia. Bordered by Russia to the
north and China to the south and
southeast, it covers an area of
1,564,116 square kilometres, making it
the 18th-largest country in the world
and the second largest landlocked
country after Kazakhstan, as well as
largest landlocked country that does
not border an inland sea. With a
population of 3.5 million, it is the
world's most sparsely populated
sovereign state. The country
constitutes a significant portion of
the Mongolian Plateau, and its natural
environment is characterized by grassy
steppe, mountains to the north and
west, and the Gobi Desert to the south.
Ulaanbaatar, the capital and largest
city, is home to roughly half of the
country's population.
