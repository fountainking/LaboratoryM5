Taiga or tayga, also known as boreal
forest or snow forest, is a biome
characterized by coniferous forests
consisting mostly of pines, spruces,

biome. In North America, it covers most
of inland Canada, Alaska, and parts of
the northern contiguous United States.
In Eurasia, it covers most of Sweden,
Finland, much of Russia from Karelia in
the west to the Pacific Ocean, much of
Norway and Estonia, some of the
Scottish Highlands, some
lowland/coastal areas of Iceland, and
areas of northern Kazakhstan, northern
Mongolia, and northern Japan.
