Yellowstone National Park

Yellowstone National Park is a national
park of the United States located in
the northwest corner of the state of
Wyoming, with small portions extending
into Montana and Idaho. It was
established by the 42nd U.S. Congress
through the Yellowstone National Park
Protection Act and signed into law by
President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1,
1872. Yellowstone was the first
national park in the US, and is also
widely understood to be the first
national park in the world. The park is
known for its wildlife and its many
geothermal features, especially the Old
Faithful geyser, one of its most
popular. While it represents many types
of biomes, subalpine forest is the most
abundant. It is part of the South
Central Rockies forests ecoregion.
