Rwanda

Rwanda, officially the Republic of
Rwanda, is a landlocked country in East
Africa. Known as the "Land of a
Thousand Hills" for its high elevation
and rolling terrain, its geography is
dominated by mountains in the west and
savanna in the southeast. The largest
and most notable lakes are mainly in
the western and northern regions of the
country, and several volcanoes that
form part of the Virunga volcanic chain
are primarily in the northwest. The
climate is considered tropical
highland, with two rainy seasons and
two dry seasons each year. Its capital
and largest city is Kigali, located at
the centre of the country, at 1,567
metres above sea level.
