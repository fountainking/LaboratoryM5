Red Sea

The Red Sea is a sea inlet of the
Indian Ocean, lying between Africa and
Asia. Its connection to the ocean is in
the south, through the Bab-el-Mandeb
Strait and the Gulf of Aden. To its
north lie the Sinai Peninsula, the Gulf
of Aqaba, and the Gulf of Suez—leading
to the Suez Canal. It is underlain by
the Red Sea Rift, which is part of the
Great Rift Valley.
