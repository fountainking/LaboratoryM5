New Zealand

New Zealand is an island country in the
southwestern Pacific Ocean. It consists
of two main landmasses—the North Island
and the South Island —and over 600
smaller islands. It is the
sixth-largest island country by area
and lies east of Australia across the
Tasman Sea and south of the islands of
New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. The
country's varied topography and sharp
mountain peaks, including the Southern
Alps, owe much to tectonic uplift and
volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's
capital city is Wellington, and its
most populous city is Auckland.
