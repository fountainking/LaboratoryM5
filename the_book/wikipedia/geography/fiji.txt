Fiji

Fiji, officially the Republic of Fiji,
is an island country in Melanesia, part
of Oceania in the South Pacific Ocean.
It lies about 1,100 nautical miles
north-northeast of New Zealand. Fiji
consists of an archipelago of more than
330 islands—of which about 110 are
permanently inhabited—and more than 500
islets, amounting to a total land area
of about 18,300 square kilometres
(7,100 sq mi). The most outlying island
group is Ono-i-Lau. About 87% of the
total population live on the two major
islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.
About three-quarters of Fijians live on
Viti Levu's coasts, either in the
capital city of Suva, or in smaller
urban centres such as Nadi or Lautoka.
The interior of Viti Levu is sparsely
inhabited because of its terrain.
