North Macedonia, officially the
Republic of North Macedonia, is a
landlocked country in Southeast Europe.
It shares land borders with Greece to
the south, Albania to the west,

of Macedonia. Skopje, the capital and

are ethnic Macedonians, a South Slavic
people. Albanians form a significant
minority at around 25%, followed by
Turks, Roma, Serbs, Bosniaks,
Aromanians and a few other minorities.
