Iceland

Iceland is a Nordic island country
between the Arctic Ocean and the North
Atlantic Ocean, located on the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge between Europe and
North America. It is culturally and
politically linked with Europe and is
the region's westernmost and most
sparsely populated country. Its capital
and largest city is Reykjavík, which is
home to about 36% of the country's
roughly 390,000 residents. The official
language of the country is Icelandic.
Iceland is on a rift between tectonic
plates, and its geologic activity
includes geysers and frequent volcanic
eruptions. The interior consists of a
volcanic plateau with sand and lava
fields, mountains and glaciers, and
many glacial rivers flow to the sea
through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed
by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate
climate, despite being at a latitude
just south of the Arctic Circle. Its
latitude and marine influence keep
summers chilly, and most of its islands
have a polar climate.
