Botswana

Botswana, officially the Republic of
Botswana, is a landlocked country in
Southern Africa. Botswana is
topographically flat, with
approximately 70% of its territory
being a part of the Kalahari Desert. It
is bordered by South Africa to the
south and southeast, Namibia to the
west and north, Zambia to the north,
and Zimbabwe to the northeast. With a
population of slightly over 2.4 million
people and a comparable land area to
France, Botswana is one of the most
sparsely populated countries in the
world. It is essentially the
nation-state of the Tswana people, who
constitute nearly 80% of the
population.
