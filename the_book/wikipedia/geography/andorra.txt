Andorra

Andorra, officially the Principality of
Andorra, is a landlocked country on the
Iberian Peninsula, in the eastern
Pyrenees in Southwestern Europe,
bordered by France to the north and
Spain to the south. Believed to have
been created by Charlemagne, Andorra
was ruled by the count of Urgell until
988, when it was transferred to the
Diocese of Urgell. The present
principality was formed by a charter in
1278. It is currently headed by two
co-princes: the Bishop of Urgell in
Catalonia, Spain, and the president of
France. Its capital and largest city is
Andorra la Vella.
