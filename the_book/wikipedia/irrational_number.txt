Irrational number

In mathematics, the irrational numbers
are all the real numbers that are not
rational numbers. That is, irrational
numbers cannot be expressed as the
ratio of two integers. When the ratio
of lengths of two line segments is an
irrational number, the line segments
are also described as being
incommensurable, meaning that they
share no "measure" in common, that is,
there is no length, no matter how
short, that could be used to express
the lengths of both of the two given
segments as integer multiples of
itself.
