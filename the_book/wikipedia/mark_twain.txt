Mark Twain

Samuel Langhorne Clemens, known by the
pen name Mark Twain, was an American
writer, humorist, and essayist. He was
praised as the "greatest humorist the
United States has produced", with
William Faulkner calling him "the
father of American literature". Twain's
novels include The Adventures of Tom
Sawyer (1876) and its sequel,
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884),
with the latter often called the "Great
American Novel". He also wrote A
Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's
Court (1889) and Pudd'nhead Wilson
(1894) and cowrote The Gilded Age: A
Tale of Today (1873) with Charles
Dudley Warner. The novelist Ernest
Hemingway claimed that "All modern
American literature comes from one book
by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn."
