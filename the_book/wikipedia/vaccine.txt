Vaccine

A vaccine is a biological preparation
that provides active acquired immunity
to a particular infectious or malignant
disease. The safety and effectiveness
of vaccines has been widely studied and
verified. A vaccine typically contains
an agent that resembles a
disease-causing microorganism and is
often made from weakened or killed
forms of the microbe, its toxins, or
one of its surface proteins. The agent
stimulates the immune system to
recognize the agent as a threat,
destroy it, and recognize further and
destroy any of the microorganisms
associated with that agent that it may
encounter in the future.
