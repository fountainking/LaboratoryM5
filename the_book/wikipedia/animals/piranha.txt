Piranha

A piranha is any of a number of
freshwater fish species in the
subfamily Serrasalminae, of the family
Serrasalmidae, in the order
Characiformes. These fish inhabit South
American rivers, floodplains, lakes and
reservoirs. Although often described as
extremely predatory and mainly feeding
on fish, their dietary habits vary
extensively, and they will also take
plant material, leading to their
classification as omnivorous.
