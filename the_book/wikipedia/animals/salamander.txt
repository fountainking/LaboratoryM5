Salamander

Salamanders are a group of amphibians
typically characterized by their
lizard-like appearance, with slender
bodies, blunt snouts, short limbs
projecting at right angles to the body,
and the presence of a tail in both
larvae and adults. All ten extant
salamander families are grouped
together under the order Urodela, the
sole surviving order from the group
Caudata. Urodela is a scientific Latin
term based on the Ancient Greek οὐρά
δήλη: ourà dēlē "conspicuous tail".
Caudata is the Latin for "tailed ones",
from cauda: "tail".
