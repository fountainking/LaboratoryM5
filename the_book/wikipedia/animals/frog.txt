Frog

A frog is any member of a diverse and
largely semiaquatic group of
short-bodied, tailless amphibian
vertebrates composing the order Anura.
Frog species with rough skin texture
due to wart-like parotoid glands tend
to be called toads, but the distinction
between frogs and toads is informal and
purely cosmetic, not from taxonomy or
evolutionary history.
