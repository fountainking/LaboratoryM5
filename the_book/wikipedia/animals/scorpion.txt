Scorpion

Scorpions are predatory arachnids with
eight legs, a pair of grasping pincers
and a narrow, segmented tail, often
carried in a characteristic forward
curve over the back and always ending
with a stinger. The evolutionary
history of scorpions goes back 435
million years. They mainly live in
deserts but have adapted to a wide
range of environmental conditions, and
can be found on all continents except
Antarctica. There are over 2,500
described species, with 22 extant
(living) families recognized to date.
Their taxonomy is being revised to
account for 21st-century genomic
studies.
