Goose

A goose is a bird of any of several
waterfowl species in the family
Anatidae. This group comprises the
genera Anser and Branta. Some members
of the Tadorninae subfamily are
commonly called geese, but are not
considered "true geese" taxonomically.
More distantly related members of the
family Anatidae are swans, most of
which are larger than true geese, and
ducks, which are smaller.
