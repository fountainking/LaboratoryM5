Camel

A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the
genus Camelus that bears distinctive
fatty deposits known as "humps" on its
back. Camels have long been
domesticated and, as livestock, they
provide food and textiles. Camels are
working animals especially suited to
their desert habitat and are a vital
means of transport for passengers and
cargo. There are three surviving
species of camel. The one-humped
dromedary makes up 94% of the world's
camel population, and the two-humped
Bactrian camel makes up 6%. The wild
Bactrian camel is a distinct species
that is not ancestral to the domestic
Bactrian camel, and is now critically
endangered, with fewer than 1,000
individuals.
