Deer

A deer or true deer is a hoofed
ruminant ungulate of the family
Cervidae. Cervidae is divided into
subfamilies Cervinae and Capreolinae.
Male deer of almost all species, as
well as female reindeer, grow and shed
new antlers each year. These antlers
are bony extensions of the skull and
are often used for combat between
males.
