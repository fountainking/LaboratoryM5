Parrot

Parrots (Psittaciformes), also known as
psittacines, are birds with a strong
curved beak, upright stance, and clawed
feet. They are classified in four
families that contain roughly 410
species in 101 genera, found mostly in
tropical and subtropical regions. The
four families are the Psittaculidae,
Psittacidae, Cacatuidae (cockatoos),
and Strigopidae. One-third of all
parrot species are threatened by
extinction, with a higher aggregate
extinction risk than any other
comparable bird group. Parrots have a
generally pantropical distribution with
several species inhabiting temperate
regions as well. The greatest diversity
of parrots is in South America and
Australasia.
