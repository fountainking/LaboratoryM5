Dog

The dog is a domesticated descendant of
the gray wolf. Also called the domestic
dog, it was selectively bred from a
population of wolves during the Late
Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. Dogs
were the first species to be
domesticated over 14,000 years ago,
before the development of agriculture.
Due to their long association with
humans, dogs have gained the ability to
thrive on a starch-rich diet that would
be inadequate for other canids.
