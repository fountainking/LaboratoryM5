Iguana

Iguana is a genus of herbivorous
lizards that are native to tropical
areas of Mexico, Central America, South
America, and the Caribbean. The genus
was first described by Austrian
naturalist J.N. Laurenti in 1768. Two
species are placed in the genus: The
green iguana, which is widespread
throughout its range and a popular pet;
and the Lesser Antillean iguana, which
is native to the Lesser Antilles.
Genetic analysis indicates that the
green iguana may comprise a complex of
multiple species, some of which have
been recently described, but the
Reptile Database considers all of these
as subspecies of the green iguana.
