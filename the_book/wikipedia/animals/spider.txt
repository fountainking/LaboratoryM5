Spider

Spiders are air-breathing arthropods
that have eight limbs, chelicerae with
fangs generally able to inject venom,
and spinnerets that extrude silk. They
are the largest order of arachnids and
rank seventh in total species diversity
among all orders of organisms. Spiders
are found worldwide on every continent
except Antarctica, and have become
established in nearly every land
habitat. As of June 2025, 53,034 spider
species in 136 families have been
recorded by taxonomists. However, there
has been debate among scientists about
how families should be classified, with
over 20 different classifications
proposed since 1900.
