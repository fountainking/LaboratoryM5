Wolf

The wolf, also known as the grey wolf
or gray wolf, is a canine native to
Eurasia and North America. More than
thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have
been recognized, including the dog and
dingo, though grey wolves, as popularly
understood, include only
naturally-occurring wild subspecies.
The wolf is the largest wild extant
member of the family Canidae, and is
further distinguished from other Canis
species by its less pointed ears and
muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and
a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless
related closely enough to smaller Canis
species, such as the coyote and the
golden jackal, to produce fertile
hybrids with them. The wolf's fur is
usually mottled white, brown, grey, and
black, although subspecies in the
arctic region may be nearly all white.
