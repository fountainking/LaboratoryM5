Gorilla

Gorillas are large, primarily
herbivorous, great apes that live in
the tropical forests of equatorial
Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided
into two species: the eastern gorilla
and the western gorilla, and either
four or five subspecies. The DNA of
gorillas is highly similar to that of
humans, from 96 to 99% depending on
what is included, and they are the next
closest living relatives to humans
after the bonobos and chimpanzees.
