Hare

Hares and jackrabbits are mammals
belonging to the genus Lepus. They are
herbivores and live solitarily or in
pairs. They nest in slight depressions
called forms, and their young are able
to fend for themselves shortly after
birth. The genus includes the largest
lagomorphs. Most are fast runners with
long, powerful hind legs, and large
ears that dissipate body heat. Hare
species are native to Africa, Eurasia
and North America. A hare less than one
year old is called a "leveret".
