Lion

The lion is a large cat of the genus
Panthera, currently found only in
Sub-Saharan Africa and India. It has a
muscular, broad-chested body; a short,
rounded head; round ears; and a dark,
hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It
is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions
are larger than females and have a
prominent mane. It is a social species,
forming groups called prides. A lion's
pride consists of a few adult males,
related females, and cubs. Groups of
female lions usually hunt together,
preying mostly on medium-sized and
large ungulates. The lion is an apex
and keystone predator.
