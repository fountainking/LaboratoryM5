Beetle

Beetles are insects that form the order
Coleoptera, in the superorder
Holometabola. Their front pair of wings
are hardened into wing-cases, elytra,
distinguishing them from most other
insects. The Coleoptera, with about
400,000 described species, is the
largest of all orders, constituting
almost 40% of described arthropods and
25% of all known animal species; new
species are discovered frequently, with
estimates suggesting that there are
between 0.9 and 2.1 million total
species. Other similarly diverse orders
are dipterans (flies) and hymenopterans
(wasps).
