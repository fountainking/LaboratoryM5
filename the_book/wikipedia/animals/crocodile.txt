Crocodile

Crocodiles or true crocodiles are
large, semiaquatic reptiles that live
throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia,
the Americas and Australia. The term
"crocodile" is sometimes used more
loosely to include all extant members
of the order Crocodilia, which includes
the alligators and caimans, the gharial
and false gharial as well as other
extinct taxa.
