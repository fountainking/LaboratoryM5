Elk

The elk or wapiti, is the second
largest species within the deer family,
Cervidae, and one of the largest
terrestrial mammals in its native range
of North America and Central and East
Asia. The word "elk" originally
referred to the European variety of the
moose, Alces alces, but was transferred
to Cervus canadensis by North American
colonists.
