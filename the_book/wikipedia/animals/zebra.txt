Zebra

Zebras are African equines with
distinctive black-and-white striped
coats. There are three living species:
Grévy's zebra, the plains zebra, and
the mountain zebra. Zebras share the
genus Equus with horses and asses, the
three groups being the only living
members of the family Equidae. Zebra
stripes come in different patterns,
unique to each individual. Several
theories have been proposed for the
function of these patterns, with most
evidence supporting them as a deterrent
for biting flies. Zebras inhabit
eastern and southern Africa and can be
found in a variety of habitats such as
savannahs, grasslands, woodlands,
shrublands, and mountainous areas.
