Goat

The goat or domestic goat is a species
of goat-antelope that is mostly kept as
livestock. It was domesticated from the
wild goat of Southwest Asia and Eastern
Europe. The goat is a member of the
family Bovidae, meaning it is closely
related to the sheep. It was one of the
first animals to be domesticated, in
Iran around 10,000 years ago.
