**CENTIPEDE**

Centipede

Centipedes are predatory arthropods
belonging to the class Chilopoda of the
subphylum Myriapoda, an arthropod group
which includes millipedes and other
multi-legged animals. Centipedes are
elongated segmented (metameric) animals
with one pair of legs per body segment.
All centipedes are venomous and can
inflict painful stings, injecting their
venom through pincer-like appendages
known as forcipules or toxicognaths,
which are actually modified legs
instead of fangs. Despite the name, no
species of centipede has exactly 100
legs; the number of pairs of legs is an
odd number that ranges from 15 pairs to
191 pairs.
