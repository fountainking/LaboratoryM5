Woodpecker

Woodpeckers are part of the bird family
Picidae, which also includes the
piculets, wrynecks and sapsuckers.
Members of this family are found
worldwide, except for Australia, New
Guinea, New Zealand, Madagascar and the
extreme polar regions. Most species
live in forests or woodland habitats,
although a few species are known that
live in treeless areas, such as rocky
hillsides and deserts, and the Gila
woodpecker specializes in exploiting
cacti.
