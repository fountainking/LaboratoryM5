Penguin

Penguins are a group of flightless,
semi-aquatic, sea birds which live
almost exclusively in the Southern
Hemisphere. Only one species, the
Galápagos penguin, lives at, and
slightly north of, the equator. Highly
adapted for life in the ocean water,
penguins have countershaded dark and
white plumage and flippers for
swimming. Most penguins feed on krill,
fish, squid and other forms of sea life
which they catch with their bills and
swallow whole while swimming. A penguin
has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to
grip slippery prey.
