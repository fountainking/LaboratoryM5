Porpoise

Porpoises are small dolphin-like
cetaceans classified under the family
Phocoenidae. Although similar in
appearance to dolphins, they are more
closely related to narwhals and
belugas. There are eight extant species
of porpoise, all among the smallest of
the toothed whales. Porpoises are
distinguished from dolphins by their
flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct
from the conical teeth of dolphins, and
lack of a pronounced beak, although
some dolphins also lack a pronounced
beak. Porpoises, and other cetaceans,
belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla
with even-toed ungulates.
