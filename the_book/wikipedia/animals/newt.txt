Newt

A newt is a salamander in the subfamily
Pleurodelinae. The terrestrial juvenile
phase is called an eft. Unlike other
members of the family Salamandridae,
newts are semiaquatic, alternating
between aquatic and terrestrial
habitats. Not all aquatic salamanders
are considered newts, however. More
than 100 known species of newts are
found in North America, Europe, North
Africa and Asia. Newts metamorphose
through three distinct developmental
life stages: aquatic larva, terrestrial
juvenile (eft), and adult. Adult newts
have lizard-like bodies and return to
the water every year to breed,
otherwise living in humid, cover-rich
land habitats.
