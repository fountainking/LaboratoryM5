Bear

Bears are carnivoran mammals of the
family Ursidae. They are classified as
caniforms, or doglike carnivorans.
Although only eight species of bears
are extant, they are widespread,
appearing in a wide variety of habitats
throughout most of the Northern
Hemisphere and partially in the
Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on
the continents of North America, South
America, and Eurasia. Common
characteristics of modern bears include
large bodies with stocky legs, long
snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy
hair, plantigrade paws with five
nonretractile claws, and short tails.
