Crow

A crow is a bird of the genus Corvus,
or more broadly, a synonym for all of
Corvus. The word "crow" is used as part
of the common name of many species. The
related term "raven" is not linked
scientifically to any certain trait but
is rather a general grouping for
larger-sized species of Corvus. The
collective name for a group of crows is
a "murder".
