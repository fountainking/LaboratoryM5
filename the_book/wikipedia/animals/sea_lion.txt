Sea lion

Sea lions are pinnipeds characterized
by external ear flaps, long
foreflippers, the ability to walk on
all fours, short and thick hair, and a
big chest and belly. Together with the
fur seals, they make up the family
Otariidae, eared seals. The sea lions
have six extant and one extinct species
in five genera. Their range extends
from the subarctic to tropical waters
of the global ocean in both the
Northern and Southern hemispheres, with
the notable exception of the northern
Atlantic Ocean.
