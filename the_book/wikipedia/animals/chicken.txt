Chicken

The chicken is a domesticated
subspecies of the red junglefowl,
originally native to Southeast Asia. It
was first domesticated around 8,000
years ago and is one of the most common
and widespread domesticated animals in
the world. Chickens are primarily kept
for their meat and eggs, though they
are also kept as pets.
