Alpaca

The alpaca is a species of South
American camelid mammal. Traditionally,
alpacas were kept in herds that grazed
on the level heights of the Andes of
Southern Peru, Western Bolivia,
Ecuador, and Northern Chile. More
recently, alpacas may be found on farms
and ranches worldwide, with thousands
of animals born and raised annually.
Alpacas are especially popular in North
America, Europe, and Australia.
