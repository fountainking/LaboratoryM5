Albatross

Albatrosses, of the biological family
Diomedeidae, are large seabirds related
to the procellariids, storm petrels,
and diving petrels in the order
Procellariiformes. They range widely in
the Southern Ocean and the North
Pacific. They are absent from the North
Atlantic, although fossil remains of
short-tailed albatross show they lived
there up to the Pleistocene, and
occasional vagrants are found. Great
albatrosses are among the largest of
flying birds, with wingspans reaching
up to 2.5–3.5 metres (8.2–11.5 ft) and
bodies over 1 metre (3.3 ft) in length.
The albatrosses are usually regarded as
falling into four genera, but
disagreement exists over the number of
species.
