Butterfly

Butterflies are winged insects from the
lepidopteran superfamily Papilionoidea,
characterised by large, often brightly
coloured wings that often fold together
when at rest, and a conspicuous,
fluttering flight. The oldest butterfly
fossils have been dated to the
Paleocene, about 56 million years ago,
though molecular evidence suggests that
they likely originated in the
Cretaceous.
