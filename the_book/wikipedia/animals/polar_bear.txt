Polar bear

The polar bear is a large bear native
to the Arctic and nearby areas. It is
closely related to the brown bear, and
the two species can interbreed. The
polar bear is the largest extant
species of bear and land carnivore by
body mass, with adult males weighing
300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb). The species
is sexually dimorphic, as adult females
are much smaller. The polar bear is
white- or yellowish-furred with black
skin and a thick layer of fat. It is
more slender than the brown bear, with
a narrower skull, longer neck and lower
shoulder hump. Its teeth are sharper
and more adapted to cutting meat. The
paws are large and allow the bear to
walk on ice and paddle in the water.
