Horse

The horse is a domesticated, one-toed,
hoofed mammal. It belongs to the
taxonomic family Equidae and is one of
two extant subspecies of Equus ferus.
The horse has evolved over the past 45
to 55 million years from a small
multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the
large, single-toed animal of today.
Humans began domesticating horses
around 4000 BCE in Central Asia, and
their domestication is believed to have
been widespread by 3000 BCE. Horses in
the subspecies caballus are
domesticated, although some
domesticated populations live in the
wild as feral horses. These feral
populations are not true wild horses,
which are horses that have never been
domesticated. There is an extensive,
specialized vocabulary used to describe
equine-related concepts, covering
everything from anatomy to life stages,
size, colors, markings, breeds,
locomotion, and behavior.
