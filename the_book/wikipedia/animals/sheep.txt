Sheep

Sheep or domestic sheep are a
domesticated, ruminant mammal typically
kept as livestock. Although the term
sheep can apply to other species in the
genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost
always refers to domesticated sheep.
Like all ruminants, sheep are members
of the order Artiodactyla, the
even-toed ungulates. Numbering a little
over one billion, domestic sheep are
also the most numerous species of
sheep. An adult female is referred to
as a ewe, an intact male as a ram,
occasionally a tup, a castrated male as
a wether, and a young sheep as a lamb.
