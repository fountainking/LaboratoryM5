Turtle

Turtles are reptiles of the order
Testudines, characterized by a special
shell developed mainly from their ribs.
Modern turtles are divided into two
major groups, the Pleurodira and
Cryptodira, which differ in the way the
head retracts. There are 360 living and
recently extinct species of turtles,
including land-dwelling tortoises and
freshwater terrapins. They are found on
most continents, some islands and, in
the case of sea turtles, much of the
ocean. Like other amniotes they breathe
air and do not lay eggs underwater,
although many species live in or around
water.
