Moose

The moose or elk is the world's
tallest, largest and heaviest extant
species of deer and the only species in
the genus Alces. It is also the
tallest, and the second-largest, land
animal in North America, falling short
only to the American bison in body
mass. Most adult male moose have broad,
palmate antlers; other members of the
deer family have pointed antlers with a
dendritic ("twig-like") configuration.
Moose inhabit the circumpolar boreal
forests or temperate broadleaf and
mixed forests of the Northern
Hemisphere, thriving in cooler,
temperate areas as well as subarctic
climates.
