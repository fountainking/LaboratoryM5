Coyote

The coyote, also known as the American
jackal, prairie wolf, or brush wolf, is
a species of canine native to North
America. It is smaller than its close
relative, the gray wolf, and slightly
smaller than the closely related
eastern wolf and red wolf. It fills
much of the same ecological niche as
the golden jackal does in Eurasia;
however, the coyote is generally
larger.
