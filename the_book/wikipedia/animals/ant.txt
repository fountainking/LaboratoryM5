Ant

Ants are eusocial insects of the family
Formicidae and, along with the related
wasps and bees, belong to the order
Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from vespoid
wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous
period. More than 13,800 of an
estimated total of 22,000 species have
been classified. They are easily
identified by their geniculate
(elbowed) antennae and the distinctive
node-like structure that forms their
slender waists.
