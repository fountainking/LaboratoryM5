Eagle

Eagle is the common name for the golden
eagle, bald eagle, and other birds of
prey in the family of the Accipitridae.
Eagles belong to several groups of
genera, some of which are closely
related. True eagles comprise the genus
Aquila. Most of the 68 species of
eagles are from Eurasia and Africa.
Outside this area, just 14 species can
be found—two in North America, nine in
Central and South America, and three in
Australia.
