Bee

Bees are winged insects that form a
monophyletic clade Anthophila within
the superfamily Apoidea of the order
Hymenoptera, with over 20,000 known
species in seven recognized families.
Some species – including honey bees,
bumblebees, and stingless bees – are
social insects living in highly
hierarchical colonies, while most
species (>90%) – including mason bees,
carpenter bees, leafcutter bees, and
sweat bees – are solitary. Members of
the most well-known bee genus, Apis,
are known to construct hexagonally
celled waxy nests called hives.
