Giraffe

The giraffe is a large African hoofed
mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa.
It is the tallest living terrestrial
animal and the largest ruminant on
Earth. It is classified under the
family Giraffidae, along with its
closest extant relative, the okapi.
Traditionally, giraffes have been
thought of as one species, Giraffa
camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.
Most recently, researchers proposed
dividing them into four extant species,
with seven subspecies, which can be
distinguished morphologically by their
fur coat patterns. Six valid extinct
species of Giraffa are known from the
fossil record.
