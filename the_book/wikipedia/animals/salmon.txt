Salmon

Salmon are any of several commercially
important species of euryhaline
ray-finned fish from the genera Salmo
and Oncorhynchus of the family
Salmonidae, native to tributaries of
the North Atlantic (Salmo) and North
Pacific (Oncorhynchus) basins. Salmon
is a colloquial or common name used for
fish in this group, but is not a
scientific name. Other closely related
fish in the same family include trout,
char, grayling, whitefish, lenok and
taimen, all coldwater fish of the
subarctic and cooler temperate regions
with some sporadic endorheic
populations in Central Asia.
