Coccinellidae

Coccinellidae is a widespread family of
small beetles. They are commonly known
as ladybugs in North America and
ladybirds in the United Kingdom; "lady"
refers to mother Mary. Entomologists
use the names ladybird beetles or lady
beetles to avoid confusion with true
bugs. The more than 6,000 described
species have a global distribution and
are found in a variety of habitats.
They are oval beetles with a domed back
and flat underside. Many of the species
have conspicuous aposematic (warning)
colours and patterns, such as red with
black spots, that warn potential
predators that they taste bad.
