Wasp

A wasp is any insect of the
narrow-waisted suborder Apocrita of the
order Hymenoptera which is neither a
bee nor an ant; this excludes the
broad-waisted sawflies (Symphyta),
which look somewhat like wasps, but are
in a separate suborder. The wasps do
not constitute a clade, a complete
natural group with a single ancestor,
as bees and ants are deeply nested
within the wasps, having evolved from
wasp ancestors. Wasps that are members
of the clade Aculeata can sting their
prey.
