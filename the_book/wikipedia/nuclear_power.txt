Nuclear power

Nuclear power is the use of nuclear
reactions to produce electricity.
Nuclear power can be obtained from
nuclear fission, nuclear decay and
nuclear fusion reactions. Presently,
the vast majority of electricity from
nuclear power is produced by nuclear
fission of uranium and plutonium in
nuclear power plants. Nuclear decay
processes are used in niche
applications such as radioisotope
thermoelectric generators in some space
probes such as Voyager 2. Reactors
producing controlled fusion power have
been operated since 1958 but have yet
to generate net power and are not
expected to be commercially available
in the near future.
