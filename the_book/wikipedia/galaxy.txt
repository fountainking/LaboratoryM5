Galaxy

A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar
remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and
dark matter bound together by gravity.
The word is derived from the Greek
galaxias (), literally 'milky', a
reference to the Milky Way galaxy that
contains the Solar System. Galaxies,
averaging an estimated 100 million
stars, range in size from dwarfs with
less than a thousand stars, to the
largest galaxies known supergiants with
one hundred trillion stars, each
orbiting its galaxy's centre of mass.
Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is
in the form of dark matter, with only a
few per cent of that mass visible in
the form of stars and nebulae.
Supermassive black holes are a common
feature at the centres of galaxies.
