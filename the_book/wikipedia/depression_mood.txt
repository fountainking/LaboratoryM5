Depression (mood)

Depression is a mental state of low
mood and aversion to activity. It
affects about 3.5% of the global
population, or about 280 million people
worldwide, as of 2020. Depression
affects a person's thoughts, behavior,
feelings, and sense of well-being. The
pleasure or joy that a person gets from
certain experiences is reduced, and the
afflicted person often experiences a
loss of motivation or interest in those
activities. People with depression may
experience sadness, feelings of
dejection or lack of hope, difficulty
in thinking and concentration,
hypersomnia or insomnia, overeating or
anorexia, or suicidal thoughts.
