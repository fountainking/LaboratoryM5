Radioactive decay

Radioactive decay is the process by
which an unstable atomic nucleus loses
energy by radiation. A material
containing unstable nuclei is
considered radioactive. Three of the
most common types of decay are alpha,
beta, and gamma decay. The weak force
is the mechanism that is responsible
for beta decay, while the other two are
governed by the electromagnetic and
nuclear forces.
