Moses

In Abrahamic religions, Moses was the
Hebrew prophet who led the Israelites
out of slavery in the Exodus from
Egypt. He is considered the most
important prophet in Judaism and
Samaritanism, and one of the most
important prophets in Christianity,
Islam, the Bah Faith, and other
Abrahamic religions. According to the
Bible and Quran, God dictated the
Mosaic Law to Moses, which he wrote
down in the five books of the Torah.
