Semiconductor

A semiconductor is a material with
electrical conductivity between that of
a conductor and an insulator. Its
conductivity can be modified by adding
impurities ("doping") to its crystal
structure. When two regions with
different doping levels are present in
the same crystal, they form a
semiconductor junction.
