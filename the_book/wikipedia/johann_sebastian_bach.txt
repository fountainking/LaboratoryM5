Johann Sebastian Bach

Johann Sebastian Bach was a German
composer and musician of the late
Baroque period. He is known for his
prolific output across a variety of
instruments and forms, including the
orchestral Brandenburg Concertos; solo
instrumental works such as the cello
suites and sonatas and partitas for
solo violin; keyboard works such as the
Goldberg Variations and The
Well-Tempered Clavier; organ works such
as the Schbler Chorales and the Toccata
and Fugue in D minor; and choral works
such as the StMatthew Passion and the
Mass in Bminor. Since the 19th-century
Bach Revival, he has been widely
regarded as one of the greatest
composers in the history of Western
music.
