**SUBTRACTION**

---------------------------------------

Subtraction

Subtraction is one of the four
arithmetic operations along with
addition, multiplication and division.
Subtraction is an operation that
represents removal of objects from a
collection. For example, in the
adjacent picture, there are 5 2
peachesmeaning 5 peaches with 2 taken
away, resulting in a total of 3
peaches. Therefore, the difference of 5
and 2 is 3; that is, 5 2 = 3. While
primarily associated with natural
numbers in arithmetic, subtraction can
also represent removing or decreasing
physical and abstract quantities using
different kinds of objects including
negative numbers, fractions, irrational
numbers, vectors, decimals, functions,
and matrices.
