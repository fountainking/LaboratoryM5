**INTERPRETER COMPUTING**

Interpreter (computing)

In computing, an interpreter is
software that executes source code
without first compiling it to machine
code. Interpreted languages differ from
compiled languages, which involve the
translation of source code into
CPU-native executable code. Depending
on the runtime environment,
interpreters may first translate the
source code to an intermediate format,
such as bytecode. Hybrid runtime
environments may also translate the
bytecode into machine code via
just-in-time compilation, as in the
case of .NET and Java, instead of
interpreting the bytecode directly.
