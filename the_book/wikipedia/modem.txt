Modem

A modulator-demodulator, commonly
referred to as a modem, is a computer
hardware device that converts data from
a digital format into a format suitable
for an analog transmission medium such
as telephone or radio. A modem
transmits data by modulating one or
more carrier wave signals to encode
digital information, while the receiver
demodulates the signal to recreate the
original digital information. The goal
is to produce a signal that can be
transmitted easily and decoded
reliably. Modems can be used with
almost any means of transmitting analog
signals, from LEDs to radio.
