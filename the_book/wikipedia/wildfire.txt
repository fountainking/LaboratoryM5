Wildfire

A wildfire, forest fire, or a bushfire
is an unplanned and uncontrolled fire
in an area of combustible vegetation.
Some natural forest ecosystems depend
on wildfire. Modern forest management
often engages in prescribed burns to
mitigate fire risk and promote natural
forest cycles. However, controlled
burns can turn into wildfires by
mistake.
