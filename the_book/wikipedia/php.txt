PHP

PHP is a general-purpose scripting
language geared towards web
development. It was originally created
by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus
Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995.
The PHP reference implementation is now
produced by the PHP Group. PHP was
originally an abbreviation of Personal
Home Page, but it now stands for the
recursive backronym PHP: Hypertext
Preprocessor.
