Blood test

A blood test is a laboratory analysis
performed on a blood sample that is
usually extracted from a vein in the
arm using a hypodermic needle, or via
fingerprick. Multiple tests for
specific blood components, such as a
glucose test or a cholesterol test, are
often grouped together into one test
panel called a blood panel or blood
work. Blood tests are often used in
health care to determine physiological
and biochemical states, such as
disease, mineral content,
pharmaceutical drug effectiveness, and
organ function. Typical clinical blood
panels include a basic metabolic panel
or a complete blood count. Blood tests
are also used in drug tests to detect
drug abuse.
