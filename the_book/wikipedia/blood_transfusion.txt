Blood transfusion

Blood transfusion is the process of
transferring blood products into a
person's circulation intravenously.
Transfusions are used for various
medical conditions to replace lost
components of the blood. Early
transfusions used whole blood, but
modern medical practice commonly uses
only components of the blood, such as
red blood cells, plasma, platelets, and
other clotting factors. White blood
cells are transfused only in very rare
circumstances, since granulocyte
transfusion has limited applications.
Whole blood has come back into use in
the trauma setting.
