Central processing unit

A central processing unit (CPU), also
called a central processor, main
processor, or just processor, is the
primary processor in a given computer.
Its electronic circuitry executes
instructions of a computer program,
such as arithmetic, logic, controlling,
and input/output (I/O) operations. This
role contrasts with that of external
components, such as main memory and I/O
circuitry, and specialized coprocessors
such as graphics processing units
(GPUs).
