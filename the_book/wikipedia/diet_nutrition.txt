Diet (nutrition)

In nutrition, diet is the sum of food
consumed by a person or other organism.
The word diet often implies the use of
specific intake of nutrition for health
or weight-management reasons. Although
humans are omnivores, each culture and
each person holds some food preferences
or some food taboos. This may be due to
personal tastes or ethical reasons.
Individual dietary choices may be more
or less healthy.
