Algorithm

In mathematics and computer science, an
algorithm is a finite sequence of
mathematically rigorous instructions,
typically used to solve a class of
specific problems or to perform a
computation. Algorithms are used as
specifications for performing
calculations and data processing. More
advanced algorithms can use
conditionals to divert the code
execution through various routes and
deduce valid inferences.
