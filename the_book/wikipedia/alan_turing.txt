Alan Turing

Alan Mathison Turing was an English
mathematician, computer scientist,
logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and
theoretical biologist. He was highly
influential in the development of
theoretical computer science, providing
a formalisation of the concepts of
algorithm and computation with the
Turing machine, which can be considered
a model of a general-purpose computer.
Turing is widely considered to be the
father of theoretical computer science.
