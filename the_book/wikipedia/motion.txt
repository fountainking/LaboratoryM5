Motion

In physics, motion is when an object
changes its position with respect to a
reference point in a given time. Motion
is mathematically described in terms of
displacement, distance, velocity,
acceleration, speed, and frame of
reference to an observer, measuring the
change in position of the body relative
to that frame with a change in time.
The branch of physics describing the
motion of objects without reference to
their cause is called kinematics, while
the branch studying forces and their
effect on motion is called dynamics.
