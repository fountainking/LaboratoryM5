Plasma (physics)

Plasma is a state of matter that
results from a gaseous state having
undergone some degree of ionization. It
thus consists of a significant portion
of charged particles. While rarely
encountered on Earth, it is estimated
that 99.9% of all ordinary matter in
the universe is plasma. Stars are
almost pure balls of plasma, and plasma
dominates the rarefied intracluster
medium and intergalactic medium. Plasma
can be artificially generated, for
example, by heating a neutral gas or
subjecting it to a strong
electromagnetic field.
