Hydrogen bond

In chemistry, a hydrogen bond (H-bond)
is a specific type of molecular
interaction that exhibits partial
covalent character and cannot be
described as a purely electrostatic
force. It occurs when a hydrogen (H)
atom, covalently bonded to a more
electronegative donor atom or group
(Dn), interacts with another
electronegative atom bearing a lone
pair of electrons—the hydrogen bond
acceptor (Ac). Unlike simple
dipole–dipole interactions, hydrogen
bonding arises from charge transfer,
orbital interactions, and quantum
mechanical delocalization, making it a
resonance-assisted interaction rather
than a mere electrostatic attraction.
