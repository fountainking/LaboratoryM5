Analytical chemistry

Analytical chemistry is the branch of
chemistry concerned with the
development and application of methods
to identify the chemical composition of
materials and quantify the amounts of
components in mixtures. It focuses on
methods to identify unknown compounds,
possibly in a mixture or solution, and
quantify a compound's presence in terms
of amount of substance, concentration,
percentage by mass or number of moles
in a mixture of compounds.
