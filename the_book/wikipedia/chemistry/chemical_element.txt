Chemical element

A chemical element is a species of atom
defined by its number of protons. The
number of protons is called the atomic
number of that element. For example,
oxygen has an atomic number of 8: each
oxygen atom has 8 protons in its
nucleus. Atoms of the same element can
have different numbers of neutrons in
their nuclei, known as isotopes of the
element. Atoms of one element can be
transformed into atoms of a different
element in nuclear reactions, which
change an atom's atomic number. Almost
all baryonic matter in the universe is
composed of elements.
