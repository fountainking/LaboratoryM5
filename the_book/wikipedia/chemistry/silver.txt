Silver

Silver is a chemical element; it has
symbol Ag and atomic number 47. A soft,
whitish-gray, lustrous transition
metal, it exhibits the highest
electrical conductivity, thermal
conductivity, and reflectivity of any
metal. Silver is found in the Earth's
crust in the pure, free elemental form,
as an alloy with gold and other metals,
and in minerals such as argentite and
chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced
as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead,
and zinc refining.
