Copper is a chemical element; it has
symbol Cu and atomic number 29. It is a
soft, malleable, and ductile metal with
very high thermal and electrical
conductivity. A freshly exposed surface
of pure copper has a pinkish-orange
color. Copper is used as a conductor of
heat and electricity, as a building
material, and as a constituent of
various metal alloys, such as sterling
silver used in jewelry, cupronickel
used to make marine hardware and coins,
and constantan used in strain gauges
and thermocouples for temperature
measurement.
