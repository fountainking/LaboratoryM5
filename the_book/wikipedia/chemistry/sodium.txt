Sodium

Sodium is a chemical element; it has
symbol Na and atomic number 11. It is a
soft, silvery-white, highly reactive
metal. Sodium is an alkali metal, being
in group 1 of the periodic table. Its
only stable isotope is 23Na. The free
metal does not occur in nature and must
be prepared from compounds. Sodium is
the sixth most abundant element in the
Earth's crust and exists in numerous
minerals such as feldspars, sodalite,
and halite (NaCl). Many salts of sodium
are highly water-soluble: sodium ions
have been leached by the action of
water from the Earth's minerals over
eons, and thus sodium and chlorine are
the most common dissolved elements by
weight in the oceans.
