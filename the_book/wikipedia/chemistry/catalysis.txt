Catalysis

Catalysis is the increase in rate of a
chemical reaction due to an added
substance known as a catalyst.
Catalysts are not consumed by the
reaction and remain unchanged after the
reaction. If the reaction is rapid and
the catalyst is recycled quickly, a
very small amount of catalyst often
suffices; mixing, surface area, and
temperature are important factors in
reaction rate. Catalysts generally
react with one or more reactants to
form intermediates that subsequently
give the final reaction product, in the
process of regenerating the catalyst.
