Covalent bond

A covalent bond is a chemical bond that
involves the sharing of electrons to
form electron pairs between atoms.
These electron pairs are known as
shared pairs or bonding pairs. The
stable balance of attractive and
repulsive forces between atoms, when
they share electrons, is known as
covalent bonding. For many molecules,
the sharing of electrons allows each
atom to attain the equivalent of a full
valence shell, corresponding to a
stable electronic configuration. In
organic chemistry, covalent bonding is
much more common than ionic bonding.
