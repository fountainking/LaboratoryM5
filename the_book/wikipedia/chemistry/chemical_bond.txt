**CHEMICAL BOND**

Chemical bond

A chemical bond is the association of
atoms or ions to form molecules,
crystals, and other structures. The
bond may result from the electrostatic
force between oppositely charged ions
as in ionic bonds or through the
sharing of electrons as in covalent
bonds, or some combination of these
effects. Chemical bonds are described
as having different strengths: there
are "strong bonds" or "primary bonds"
such as covalent, ionic and metallic
bonds, and "weak bonds" or "secondary
bonds" such as dipole–dipole
interactions, the London dispersion
force, and hydrogen bonding.
