Carbon

Carbon is a chemical element; it has
symbol C and atomic number 6. It is
nonmetallic and tetravalent—meaning
that its atoms are able to form up to
four covalent bonds due to its valence
shell exhibiting 4 electrons. It
belongs to group 14 of the periodic
table. Carbon makes up about 0.025
percent of Earth's crust. Three
isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C
being stable, while 14C is a
radionuclide, decaying with a half-life
of 5,700 years. Carbon is one of the
few elements known since antiquity.
