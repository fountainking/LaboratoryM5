Enzyme

An enzyme is a biological
macromolecule, usually a protein, that
acts as a biological catalyst,
accelerating chemical reactions without
being consumed in the process. The
molecules on which enzymes act are
called substrates, which are converted
into products. Nearly all metabolic
processes within a cell depend on
enzyme catalysis to occur at
biologically relevant rates. Metabolic
pathways are typically composed of a
series of enzyme-catalyzed steps. The
study of enzymes is known as
enzymology, and a related field focuses
on pseudoenzymes—proteins that have
lost catalytic activity but may retain
regulatory or scaffolding functions,
often indicated by alterations in their
amino acid sequences or unusual
'pseudocatalytic' behavior.
