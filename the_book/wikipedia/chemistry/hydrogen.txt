Hydrogen

Hydrogen is a chemical element; it has
the symbol H and atomic number 1. It is
the lightest and most abundant chemical
element in the universe, constituting
about 75% of all normal matter. Under
standard conditions, hydrogen is a gas
of diatomic molecules with the formula
H2, called dihydrogen, or sometimes
hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or
simply hydrogen. Dihydrogen is
colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and
highly combustible. Stars, including
the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in
a plasma state, while on Earth,
hydrogen is found as the gas H2
(dihydrogen) and in molecules, such as
in water and organic compounds. The
most common isotope of hydrogen, 1H,
consists of one proton, one electron,
and no neutrons.
