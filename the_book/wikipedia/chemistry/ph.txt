PH

In chemistry, pH (/ is a logarithmic
scale used to specify the acidity or
basicity of aqueous solutions. Acidic
solutions are measured to have lower pH
values than basic or alkaline
solutions. While the origin of the
symbol 'pH' can be traced back to its
original inventor, and the 'H' refers
clearly to hydrogen, the exact original
meaning of the letter 'p' in pH is
still disputed; it has since acquired a
more general technical meaning that is
used in numerous other contexts.
