Biochemistry

Biochemistry, or biological chemistry,
is the study of chemical processes
within and relating to living
organisms. A sub-discipline of both
chemistry and biology, biochemistry may
be divided into three fields:
structural biology, enzymology, and
metabolism. Over the last decades of
the 20th century, biochemistry has
become successful at explaining living
processes through these three
disciplines. Almost all areas of the
life sciences are being uncovered and
developed through biochemical
methodology and research. Biochemistry
focuses on understanding the chemical
basis that allows biological molecules
to give rise to the processes that
occur within living cells and between
cells, in turn relating greatly to the
understanding of tissues and organs as
well as organism structure and
function. Biochemistry is closely
related to molecular biology, the study
of the molecular mechanisms of
biological phenomena.
