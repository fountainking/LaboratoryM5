Chemical compound

A chemical compound is a chemical
substance composed of many identical
molecules containing atoms from more
than one chemical element held together
by chemical bonds. A molecule
consisting of atoms of only one element
is therefore not a compound. A compound
can be transformed into a different
substance by a chemical reaction, which
may involve interactions with other
substances. In this process, bonds
between atoms may be broken or new
bonds formed or both.
