Metallic bonding

Metallic bonding is a type of chemical
bonding that arises from the
electrostatic attractive force between
conduction electrons and positively
charged metal ions. It may be described
as the sharing of free electrons among
a structure of positively charged ions
(cations). Metallic bonding accounts
for many physical properties of metals,
such as strength, ductility, thermal
and electrical resistivity and
conductivity, opacity, and lustre.
