Methane

Methane is a chemical compound with the
chemical formula CH4. It is a group-14
hydride, the simplest alkane, and the
main constituent of natural gas. The
abundance of methane on Earth makes it
an economically attractive fuel,
although capturing and storing it is
difficult because it is a gas at
standard temperature and pressure. In
the Earth's atmosphere methane is
transparent to visible light but
absorbs infrared radiation, acting as a
greenhouse gas. Methane is an organic
compound, and among the simplest of
organic compounds. Methane is also a
hydrocarbon.
