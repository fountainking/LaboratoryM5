Vitamin

Vitamins are organic molecules that are
essential to an organism in small
quantities for proper metabolic
function. These essential nutrients
cannot be synthesized in the organism
in sufficient quantities for survival,
and therefore must be obtained through
the diet. For example, vitamin C can be
synthesized by some species but not by
others; it is not considered a vitamin
in the first instance but is in the
second. Most vitamins are not single
molecules, but groups of related
molecules called vitamers. For example,
there are eight vitamers of vitamin E:
four tocopherols and four tocotrienols.
