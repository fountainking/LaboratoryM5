Polymer

A polymer is a substance or material
that consists of very large molecules,
or macromolecules, that are constituted
by many repeating subunits derived from
one or more species of monomers. Due to
their broad spectrum of properties,
both synthetic and natural polymers
play essential and ubiquitous roles in
everyday life. Polymers range from
familiar synthetic plastics such as
polystyrene to natural biopolymers such
as DNA and proteins that are
fundamental to biological structure and
function. Polymers, both natural and
synthetic, are created via
polymerization of many small molecules,
known as monomers. Their consequently
large molecular mass, relative to small
molecule compounds, produces unique
physical properties including
toughness, high elasticity,
viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form
amorphous and semicrystalline
structures rather than crystals.
