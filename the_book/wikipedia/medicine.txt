Medicine

Medicine is the science and practice of
caring for patients, managing the
diagnosis, prognosis, prevention,
treatment, palliation of their injury
or disease, and promoting their health.
Medicine encompasses a variety of
health care practices evolved to
maintain and restore health by the
prevention and treatment of illness.
Contemporary medicine applies
biomedical sciences, biomedical
research, genetics, and medical
technology to diagnose, treat, and
prevent injury and disease, typically
through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but
also through therapies as diverse as
psychotherapy, external splints and
traction, medical devices, biologics,
and ionizing radiation, amongst others.
