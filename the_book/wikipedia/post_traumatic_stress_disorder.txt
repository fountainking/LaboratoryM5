Post-traumatic stress disorder

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
is a mental disorder that develops from
experiencing a traumatic event, such as
sexual assault, domestic violence,
child abuse, warfare and its associated
traumas, natural disaster, bereavement,
traffic collision, or other threats on
a person's life or well-being. Symptoms
may include disturbing thoughts,
feelings, or dreams related to the
events, mental or physical distress to
trauma-related cues, attempts to avoid
trauma-related cues, alterations in the
way a person thinks and feels, and an
increase in the fight-or-flight
response. These symptoms last for more
than a month after the event and can
include triggers such as misophonia.
Young children are less likely to show
distress, but instead may express their
memories through play.
