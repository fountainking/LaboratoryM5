Force

In physics, a force is an action that
can cause an object to change its
velocity or its shape, or to resist
other forces, or to cause changes of
pressure in a fluid. In mechanics,
force makes ideas like 'pushing' or
'pulling' mathematically precise.
Because the magnitude and direction of
a force are both important, force is a
vector quantity. The SI unit of force
is the newton (N), and force is often
represented by the symbol F.
