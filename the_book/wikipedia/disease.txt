Disease

A disease is a particular abnormal
condition that adversely affects the
structure or function of all or part of
an organism and is not immediately due
to any external injury. Diseases are
often known to be medical conditions
that are associated with specific signs
and symptoms. A disease may be caused
by external factors such as pathogens
or by internal dysfunctions. For
example, internal dysfunctions of the
immune system can produce a variety of
different diseases, including various
forms of immunodeficiency,
hypersensitivity, allergies, and
autoimmune disorders.
