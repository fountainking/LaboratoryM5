**06 ICE SNOW WATER**

Category: Survival › Water
---------------------------------------

**WATER FROM ICE AND SNOW - COLD
**WEATHER****

**CRITICAL WARNING:**
Never eat snow/ice directly!
- Lowers core body temperature
- Causes dehydration (body uses water
to melt it)
- Can cause hypothermia
- Wastes precious calories

**MELTING SNOW FOR WATER:**

**EFFICIENCY TIPS:**
- Start with small amount in pot
- Add snow gradually as it melts
- Takes 10 parts snow = 1 part water
- Packed snow yields more than powder

**HEAT SOURCES:**
1. Fire (most efficient)
2. Body heat (emergency only - wastes
calories)
3. Sunlight (black container in sun)

**COLOR SELECTION:**
WHITE SNOW: Always safe when melted
PINK/RED SNOW: Algae - safe but tastes
bad
YELLOW SNOW: Never use
(urine/contaminated)
BLUE ICE: Old glacier ice - safe, most
water per volume

**ICE VS SNOW:**
ICE is better:
- Less volume needed (already
compressed)
- Melts to more water per weight
- Takes less fuel to melt
- Clear ice = purest water

SEA ICE (Coastal):
OLD SEA ICE (Blue/black, rounded):
- Most salt has leached out
- Safe to melt and drink
- Tastes slightly brackish but usable

NEW SEA ICE (White, sharp):
- Still very salty
- Do NOT drink
- Can cause dehydration and kidney
failure

TEST: Taste tiny bit. If salty, don't
use.

**EFFICIENT MELTING METHOD:**
1. Fill pot 1/4 with water (from
previous melt)
2. Add snow/ice gradually
3. Keep adding as it melts
4. Never burn dry - wastes fuel and
damages pot

**SOLAR MELTING:**
- Dark colored bag with snow
- Leave in sun
- Insulate with clothing
- Slow but saves fuel
- Can yield 1-2 liters per day

BODY HEAT MELTING (Emergency Only):
- Put snow in water bottle
- Keep bottle inside coat
- Your body heat melts it
- ONLY if you have calories to spare
- ONLY if desperate

**DAILY WATER NEEDS IN COLD:**
- Still need 3-5 liters per day
- Cold air is dry - dehydrates fast
- Breathing cold air uses moisture
- Easy to forget to drink when cold
- FORCE yourself to drink

**WARNING SIGNS OF DEHYDRATION IN
**COLD:****
- Dark yellow urine
- Reduced urination
- Headache
- Fatigue (different from cold fatigue)
- Dizziness

**ALTITUDE + COLD:**
- Need even MORE water at altitude
- 4-6 liters per day above 10,000 feet
- Altitude sickness worsens with
dehydration
