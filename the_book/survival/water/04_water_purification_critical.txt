**04 WATER PURIFICATION CRITICAL**

Category: Survival › Water
---------------------------------------

**WATER PURIFICATION - LIFE OR DEATH**

PRIORITY: Always purify if possible.
Diarrhea can kill you faster than
contaminated water.

**CONTAMINATION TYPES:**
1. BIOLOGICAL: Bacteria, viruses,
parasites (most common)
2. CHEMICAL: Pesticides, heavy metals
(rare in wilderness)
3. PARTICULATE: Dirt, debris (easiest
to remove)

**METHOD 1: BOILING (MOST RELIABLE)**
- Rolling boil for 1 minute (sea level)
- 3 minutes above 6,500 feet elevation
- Kills ALL biological contaminants
- Does NOT remove chemicals or heavy
metals
- Let cool, oxygenate by pouring
between containers

**METHOD 2: FILTRATION**
**IMPROVISED FILTER:**
Layer from bottom to top in container
with hole:
1. Small stones/gravel (2 inches)
2. Coarse sand (2 inches)
3. Fine sand (2 inches)
4. Charcoal from fire (2 inches) -
CRITICAL for chemicals
5. Cloth or grass (top layer)

Pour water through slowly
Removes particles and some chemicals
DOES NOT remove viruses or all bacteria
STILL BOIL AFTER FILTERING if possible

**METHOD 3: CHEMICAL PURIFICATION**
**IODINE TABLETS:**
- 2 tablets per liter
- Wait 30 minutes
- Doubles in cold water
- Don't use if pregnant

BLEACH (Unscented only):
- 2 drops per liter of clear water
- 4 drops per liter of cloudy water
- Wait 30 minutes
- Should have slight chlorine smell
- If not, repeat dose and wait 15 more
minutes

**METHOD 4: UV SUNLIGHT (SODIS)**
- Fill clear plastic bottle
- Shake to oxygenate
- Place in direct sunlight for 6 hours
(2 days if cloudy)
- UV kills pathogens
- Works ONLY in clear bottles
- Water must be clear (filter first if
cloudy)

METHOD 5: SURVIVAL STILL (Solar)
- Dig hole in sunny spot
- Place container in center
- Cover hole with clear plastic
- Place rock in center of plastic (over
container)
- Seal edges with dirt
- Water evaporates, condenses on
plastic, drips into container
- Produces 1-2 liters per day
- 100% pure distilled water

**EMERGENCY - NO PURIFICATION
AVAILABLE:**
Choose water source in this order:
1. Spring water (cleanest)
2. Fast-moving stream (rocks = oxygen =
cleaner)
3. Lake (deep water, away from shore)
4. Pond (stagnant - high risk)
5. Swamp (last resort - very dangerous)

Never drink:
- Water with dead animals nearby
- Water with chemical smell
- Water with rainbow sheen (oil)
- Water with foam (detergent)
