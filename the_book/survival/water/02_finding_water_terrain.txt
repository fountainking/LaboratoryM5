---------------------------------------

**FINDING WATER - TERRAIN INDICATORS**

WATER FLOWS DOWNHILL - Follow these
signs:

**VALLEYS & RAVINES:**
- Water collects at lowest points
- Look for green vegetation
- Listen for running water (travels far
in quiet wilderness)
- Check dried creek beds - dig at
lowest point

**ROCK FORMATIONS:**
- Limestone/porous rock holds water
- Look for seeps and springs at base of
cliffs
- Water collects in rock depressions
after rain
- Moss on north side of rocks indicates
moisture

**VEGETATION INDICATORS (CRITICAL):**
These plants mean water is within 10
feet underground:

WILLOWS: Water within 6-10 feet
COTTONWOODS: Water within 10-15 feet
CATTAILS: Standing water or very
shallow water table
SYCAMORES: Year-round water source
nearby
SALT CEDAR: Water within 10 feet (but
often alkaline)
GREASEWO<br/>OD: Water within 15-20
feet
ARROW WEED: Shallow water table

FERNS & MOSS: Moist environment,
possible seep nearby

**DIG FOR WATER:**
- Outside bend of dried creek bed (3-6
feet down)
- Base of green vegetation in dry areas
- Sandy/gravelly soil easier to dig
than clay
- Dig until soil is moist, wait for
water to seep

**MORNING DEW COLLECTION:**
- Tie absorbent cloth around ankles
- Walk through grass at dawn
- Wring out into container
- Can collect 1 liter/hour in good
conditions
