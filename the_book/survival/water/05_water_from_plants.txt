**WATER FROM PLANTS - EMERGENCY
**METHODS****

**VINE WATER (HIGH YIELD):**

larger)
2. Cut high first, as high as you can
reach
3. Cut low second, 12 inches from
ground
4. Let water drip into mouth/container
5. Test first drop on skin - if no
irritation, safe

**GOOD VINES:**
- Grape vines (excellent)
- Rattan (tropical)
- Any vine that drips clear, odorless
water

**BAD VINES:**
- Milky sap = POISON
- Colored sap = POISON
- Bitter taste = POISON

**BAMBOO WATER:**
- Shake green bamboo - hear water
sloshing?
- Cut notch at base of section
- Water inside is sterile and safe
- Old yellow bamboo = no water

BARREL CACTUS (Desert Emergency):
1. Cut off top third
2. Mash pulp inside
3. Let juice accumulate (2-3 hours)
4. Strain through cloth
5. Yields 1-2 liters
WARNING: Can cause diarrhea. Use only
in dire emergency.

**PRICKLY PEAR CACTUS:**
- Pads contain moisture
- Peel off spines carefully
- Cut open and suck pulp
- Not true water but helps with
hydration

COCONUTS (Tropical):
- Green coconuts have most water (1-2
cups)
- Brown coconuts have less liquid
- Coconut water is sterile inside
- Excellent electrolyte balance

TREE WATER (Morning Collection):
1. Tie plastic bag around leafy branch
2. Place small stone in bag to create
low point

**BANANA/PLANTAIN PLANTS:**

WATER VINES (Tropical):
Look for vines on trees. Cut high, then
low.
Good indicators:

**RAIN COLLECTION:**
- Large leaves funnel into container
