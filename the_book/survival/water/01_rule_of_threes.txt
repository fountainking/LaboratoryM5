Category: Survival › Water
---------------------------------------

**RULE OF THREES - SURVIVAL
**PRIORITIES****

**YOU CAN SURVIVE:**
- 3 minutes without air
(suffocation/drowning)
- 3 hours without shelter (extreme
weather)
- 3 days without water
- 3 weeks without food

WATER IS YOUR #1 PRIORITY after shelter
in extreme weather.

**DEHYDRATION STAGES:**
1-5% Loss: Thirst, discomfort, fatigue
6-10% Loss: Headache, dizziness,
inability to walk
11-12% Loss: Delirium, swollen tongue
>12% Loss: Death

**DAILY WATER NEEDS:**
- Minimum: 2 liters (survival)
- Active: 3-4 liters
- Hot climate: 6-8 liters
- Cold climate: 3-5 liters (yes, you
still need water!)

NEVER wait until you're thirsty. Thirst
means you're already dehydrated.
