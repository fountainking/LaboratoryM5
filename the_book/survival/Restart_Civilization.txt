- Geometry (building, land surveying)
- Algebra (engineering calculations)
- Trigonometry (navigation, astronomy)
- Calculus (advanced engineering)

SOCIAL ORGANIZATION
--------------------
EDUCATION SYSTEM:
- Mandatory schooling ages 5-16
- Apprenticeship programs
- University for advanced knowledge
- Teacher training
- Technical schools

ECONOMIC STRUCTURE:

COMMON FAILURE POINTS
----------------------
1. **Ignoring sanitation** → Plague wipes out settlement
2. **No knowledge preservation** → Re-inventing everything
3. **Authoritarian rule** → Civil war destroys progress
4. **Neglecting defense** → Raiders destroy settlement
5. **Monoculture farming** → Famine from crop failure
6. **No education system** → Knowledge lost in one generation
7. **Resource hoarding** → Social collapse
8. **Rapid expansion** → Supply lines break
9. **Skipping basic tech** → Advanced systems fail
10. **Forgetting history** → Repeating old mistakes

THE 100-YEAR PLAN
------------------
YEAR 10: Village of 100+ people, basic agriculture
YEAR 25: Town of 500+, trade networks, basic industry
YEAR 50: City of 2000+, steam power, railways
YEAR 75: Multiple cities, telecommunications, electricity
YEAR 100: Nation rebuilt, modern medicine, industrial base

CRITICAL RESOURCES TO SECURE EARLY:
------------------------------------
**TOOLS:**
- Axes, saws, hammers (salvage first, forge later)
- Plows and farming implements
- Blacksmithing tools
- Medical instruments
- Measuring tools

**MATERIALS:**

- Preserve genetic diversity
- Seed vault (temperature controlled)

**BOOKS (Most valuable items):**
1. Encyclopedia Britannica (all volumes)
2. Medical textbook collection
3. Engineering handbooks
4. Agricultural guides
5. Chemistry/Physics textbooks
6. Military strategy and tactics
7. This survival guide!

FINAL WISDOM
-------------
Rebuilding civilization is a multi-generational project.
The first generation survives.
The second generation builds.
The third generation thrives.

Your job: Ensure knowledge doesn't die with you.

"We stand on the shoulders of giants.
Be a giant for those who come after."

**REMEMBER:**
It took humanity 10,000 years to reach modern civilization.
With preserved knowledge, you can do it in 100.

Don't waste the advantage.
