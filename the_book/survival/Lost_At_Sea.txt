**LOST AT SEA SURVIVAL GUIDE**
Category: Survival › Maritime
===============================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (First Hour)
-------------------------------
1. STOP PANIC - Control breathing
2. ASSESS SITUATION:
   - Life raft inflated and secured?
   - Emergency supplies inventory
   - Injuries requiring attention
   - Current weather conditions
   - Last known position

3. ACTIVATE DISTRESS SIGNALS:
   - EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon)
   - Flares (save for when rescue likely)
   - Mirror signals during day
   - Strobe lights at night
   - Radio mayday calls

WATER - YOUR LIFE PRIORITY
---------------------------
NEVER DRINK SEAWATER (causes kidney failure)

RAINWATER COLLECTION:
- Use tarp/sail to funnel into containers
- First rain rinses salt - discard it
- Collect in ANY container available
- Ration: 1 liter per day minimum

EMERGENCY WATER SOURCES:
- Fish eyes and spinal fluid (small amounts)
- Turtle blood (dangerous - last resort)
- Condensation from solar stills
- Morning dew collected from surfaces

SOLAR STILL CONSTRUCTION:
1. Float container in seawater
2. Cover with clear plastic
3. Weight center to create cone
4. Condensation drips into container
5. Produces 1-2 pints per day

FOOD ACQUISITION
-----------------
FISHING WITHOUT GEAR:
- Improvise hooks from safety pins, bones
- Use clothing threads as line
- Bait: torn cloth, shiny metal bits
- Fish guts attract more fish
- Hand catch small fish at night (attracted to light)

EDIBLE FROM SEA:
- Small fish (avoid pufferfish, triggerfish)
- Seaweed (dried, provides minerals)
- Barnacles scraped from raft
- Plankton filtered through cloth
- Turtle meat (cook thoroughly)

DO NOT EAT:
- Fish with spines/bristles
- Fish that puff up
- Fish with parrot-like beaks
- Anything that smells like ammonia

EXPOSURE PROTECTION
--------------------
SUN EXPOSURE (will kill you faster than hunger):
- Cover all skin
- Make shade from any material
- Wet clothing for cooling
- Protect eyes (snow blindness equivalent)
- Lips crack and bleed - cover them

HYPOTHERMIA PREVENTION:
- Stay as dry as possible
- Huddle together for warmth
- Insulate from raft floor
- Wring out wet clothing
- Exercise moderately to generate heat

MENTAL SURVIVAL
----------------
PSYCHOLOGY OF ISOLATION:
- Establish daily routines
- Keep a log (date, weather, fish caught)
- Set small achievable goals
- Talk to yourself (maintains sanity)
- Pray, meditate, or visualize rescue

HOPE MAINTENANCE:
- Remember: humans have survived 130+ days adrift
- Calculate drift based on currents
- Watch for birds (indicate land within 100 miles)
- Cloud formations show islands
- Never give up - rescues happen

NAVIGATION & RESCUE
-------------------
DETERMINE POSITION:
- Sun rises east, sets west
- North Star (Northern Hemisphere)
- Southern Cross (Southern Hemisphere)
- Prevailing wind direction
- Ocean current patterns

INCREASE RESCUE CHANCES:
- Stay in shipping lanes if possible
- Move toward land-indicating signs
- Signal aircraft aggressively
- Maintain bright colored clothing visible
- Keep mirrors and flares ready

BIRD BEHAVIOR:
- Birds flying in groups → heading to land
- Birds diving → fish (you can eat too)
- Circling birds → possible rescue ship

CLOUD READING:
- Stationary clouds → land underneath
- Greenish tint on clouds → vegetation reflection
- Dark clouds → rain (COLLECT IT!)

HEALTH MANAGEMENT
------------------
PREVENT INFECTIONS:
- Keep wounds clean with seawater
- Don't scratch saltwater sores
- Protect from sun (prevents skin cancer)
- Stay as dry as possible

FOOT CARE:
- Keep feet dry when possible
- Flex toes and ankles regularly
- Prevent trench foot (rotting from moisture)
- Air out feet daily if safe

SANITATION:
- Urinate in ocean (away from water collection)
- Defecate over side (attracts fish)
- Keep living area clean
- Separate sick from healthy if multiple survivors

COMMON FATAL MISTAKES
----------------------
1. Drinking seawater (dehydration death)
2. Not collecting first rain
3. Eating toxic fish
4. Giving up hope too early
5. Swimming away from raft
6. Using all flares at once
7. Not protecting from sun
8. Fighting among survivors
9. Eating without water
10. Abandoning raft for "nearby" land

SHARK DEFENSE
--------------
IF SHARKS CIRCLE:
- Stay calm - no splashing
- Keep limbs in raft
- Don't urinate in water
- Hit shark's nose if attacks
- Gouge eyes and gills
- Never play dead

RAFT MAINTENANCE
-----------------
DAILY CHECKS:
- Inspect for leaks
- Patch holes immediately
- Check sea anchor
- Secure all supplies
- Bail water constantly

EMERGENCY REPAIRS:
- Plug leaks with cloth + waterproof tape
- Use life jacket as flotation if raft fails
- Improvise paddles from debris
- Create makeshift sea anchor to slow drift

FINAL WISDOM
-------------
THE RULE OF 3s:
- 3 minutes without air
- 3 hours without shelter (in harsh conditions)
- 3 days without water
- 3 weeks without food

PRIORITIES IN ORDER:
1. Signal for rescue
2. Collect water
3. Protect from elements
4. Find food
5. Navigate toward land
6. Maintain hope

Remember: The ocean is not your enemy.
Panic is. Dehydration is. Giving up is.
Stay calm, stay hydrated, stay hopeful.

You. Will. Survive.
