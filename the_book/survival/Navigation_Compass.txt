**NAVIGATION WITH COMPASS**

**COMPLETE GUIDE TO COMPASS
**NAVIGATION****

**COMPASS BASICS:**

**PARTS OF A COMPASS:**
- Base plate (transparent)
- Rotating bezel/dial
- Magnetic needle (red points north)
- Direction of travel arrow
- Orienting arrow
- Orienting lines
- Index line

**CARDINAL DIRECTIONS:**
- North: 0° or 360°
- East: 90°
- South: 180°
- West: 270°

**TAKING A BEARING:**

**FROM MAP:**
1. Place compass on map
2. Align edge with start and
destination
3. Rotate bezel until N aligns with map
north
4. Read bearing at index line

**IN FIELD:**
1. Point direction of travel at target
2. Rotate bezel until red needle in
orienting arrow
3. Read bearing at index line

**FOLLOWING A BEARING:**
1. Set bearing on compass
2. Hold compass level at waist
3. Rotate body until needle in arrow
4. Follow direction of travel arrow
5. Pick intermediate landmarks
6. Recheck frequently

**DECLINATION:**

**WHAT IT IS:**
- Difference between true north and
magnetic north
- Varies by location
- Changes over time
- Must adjust for accuracy

**TYPES:**
- EAST declination: Add to bearing
- WEST declination: Subtract from
bearing
- Remember: "West is best, East is
least"

**ADJUSTING:**
Manual method:
- Rotate bezel by declination amount
- East: rotate right
- West: rotate left

**TRIANGULATION:**

**FINDING YOUR POSITION:**
1. Take bearing to known landmark A
2. Draw line on map from landmark
3. Take bearing to landmark B
4. Draw second line
5. Your position is where lines cross

Need 2-3 landmarks for accuracy

**NAVIGATION TECHNIQUES:**

**AIMING OFF:**
- Deliberately aim left/right of
destination
- Then know which way to turn
- Useful for linear features (rivers,
roads)

**CATCHING FEATURES:**
- Use feature beyond destination
- Know you've gone too far if you hit
it
- Safety backup

**BOXING:**
- Navigate around obstacle
- Use 90° turns
- Maintain direction

**PACING:**
- Count steps to measure distance
- Calibrate your pace count
- Average: 1000 paces = 1 km
- Varies with terrain

**HANDRAIL NAVIGATION:**
- Follow linear feature (river, ridge)
- Easier than compass bearing
- Use when available

**NIGHT NAVIGATION:**
- More difficult
- Use illuminated compass
- Choose larger landmarks
- Go slower
- Double-check bearings

**CHALLENGING CONDITIONS:**

**DENSE FOREST:**
- Shorter legs
- More frequent checks
- Use sun direction
- Mark trail

**MOUNTAINS:**
- Account for up/down
- Pace count changes with slope
- Use contour lines
- Identify peaks/valleys

**DESERT:**
- Few landmarks
- Mirage confusion
- Use celestial navigation backup
- Mark trail

**EMERGENCY NAVIGATION:**

**WITHOUT COMPASS:**
- Sun (rises east, sets west)
- Stars (North Star, Southern Cross)
- Moon
- Watch method
- Shadow stick

**SUN NAVIGATION:**
- At noon, sun is south (Northern
Hemisphere)
- Morning: east, Evening: west
- Shadow points opposite sun

**STAR NAVIGATION:**
Northern Hemisphere:
- Find North Star (Polaris)
- Use Big Dipper pointer stars
- Polaris marks true north

Southern Hemisphere:
- Use Southern Cross
- Extended long axis points south

**WATCH METHOD:**
- Point hour hand at sun
- Bisect angle between hand and 12
- That's south (Northern Hemisphere)

**SHADOW STICK:**
1. Place stick vertical in ground
2. Mark end of shadow
3. Wait 15-20 minutes
4. Mark new shadow end
5. Line connects west to east

**NAVIGATION ERRORS:**

**COMMON MISTAKES:**
- Not adjusting for declination
- Reading wrong end of needle
- Not holding compass level
- Deviation from iron objects
- Not rechecking bearing

**AVOIDING ERRORS:**
- Practice in known areas
- Cross-check with other methods
- Use multiple techniques
- Stay aware of position
- Mark progress

**EQUIPMENT CARE:**

**COMPASS MAINTENANCE:**
- Keep away from magnets/metal
- Protect from drops
- Check bubble isn't cracked
- Verify accuracy periodically
- Carry backup

**PRACTICE EXERCISES:**
1. Take bearings to known objects
2. Follow bearing to destination
3. Plot course on map
4. Triangulate position
5. Navigate at night
6. Practice without landmarks

**TIPS FOR ACCURACY:**
- Hold compass steady
- Stand still when reading
- Multiple readings average out error
- Check bearing every few minutes
- Account for drift/curves

**SURVIVAL PRIORITIES:**
1. Know general direction
2. Maintain awareness
3. Mark your trail
4. Have backup navigation
5. Don't panic if lost
