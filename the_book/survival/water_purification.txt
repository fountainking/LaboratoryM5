Methods to make water safe for
drinking in survival situations.

BOILING (Most Reliable):

high altitude)
3. Let cool before drinking
Kills: All pathogens

**CHEMICAL TREATMENT:**
Iodine Tablets:
- 2 tablets per liter
- Wait 30 minutes
- Neutralize with Vitamin C

Bleach (unscented):
- 2 drops per liter (clear water)
- 4 drops per liter (cloudy water)
- Wait 30 minutes
- Should smell slightly of chlorine

**FILTRATION:**
Commercial filter: Follow instructions
DIY filter layers (top to bottom):
1. Cloth
2. Charcoal
3. Sand
4. Gravel
5. Pebbles
Note: Still boil after filtering

**SOLAR DISINFECTION (SODIS):**
1. Clear plastic bottle
2. Fill with water
3. Place in direct sun 6 hours
(2 days if cloudy)
Works: UV kills pathogens

**SIGNS OF CONTAMINATION:**
- Cloudy appearance
- Bad smell
- Dead animals nearby
- Stagnant water
- Downstream from human activity

WATER SOURCES (Best to Worst):
