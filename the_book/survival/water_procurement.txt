Water Procurement & Purification

CRITICAL: Human can survive only 3 days
without water. Finding and purifying
water is your #1 priority.

**FINDING WATER SOURCES:**
Natural Sources:
- Streams, rivers, lakes
- Springs (best quality)
- Morning dew (collect with cloth)
- Rain (collect with tarp/container)
- Snow/ice (melt before drinking)
- Plant transpiration bags
- Solar still

Signs of Water:
- Animal tracks converging
- Insects (esp. bees, flies)
- Birds flying at dawn/dusk
- Green vegetation
- Follow valleys downhill
- Look for damp/dark soil

**WATER PURIFICATION METHODS:**
1. Boiling (BEST):
- Bring to rolling boil
- Boil 1 min (sea level)
- Boil 3 min (high altitude)
- Kills all pathogens
- Cool before drinking

2. Chemical Treatment:
Iodine tablets:
- 2 tablets per liter
- Wait 30 minutes
- Double time if water is cold

Bleach (unscented only):
- 2 drops per liter (clear water)
- 4 drops per liter (cloudy)
- Wait 30 minutes
- Should smell slightly of chlorine

3. Filtration:
Commercial filters:
- 0.2 micron removes bacteria
- 0.02 micron removes viruses
- Follow manufacturer instructions

Improvised filter:
- Layer: cloth, sand, charcoal, gravel
- Removes sediment, NOT pathogens
- Must still boil or treat

4. UV Light:
- SteriPEN or similar
- 90 seconds per liter
- Only works in clear water
- Requires batteries

**SOLAR STILL:**
Materials needed:
- Plastic sheet (6'x6')
- Container
- Small rock
- Digging tool

Construction:
1. Dig hole 3ft wide, 2ft deep
2. Place container in center
3. Cover hole with plastic
4. Weight center with rock
5. Seal edges with soil
6. Condensation drips into container
7. Yields 0.5-1 quart per day

**WATER FROM PLANTS:**
Morning Dew:
- Tie cloth around ankles
- Walk through grass at dawn
- Wring out cloth into container

Transpiration Bag:
- Clear plastic bag over green foliage
- Seal around branch
- Water condenses in bag
- Check after 2-3 hours

Vine Water:
- Cut vine high, then low
- Water drips from bottom
- Test: rub on skin (avoid
milky/bitter)
- Safe vines: grape, some tropical

**WATER CONSERVATION:**
- Breathe through nose
- Avoid physical exertion in heat
- Stay in shade
- Don't ration water (drink what you
have)
- Avoid alcohol/caffeine
- Don't eat if water scarce (digestion
needs water)

**DANGEROUS WATER:**
Avoid:
- Stagnant pools
- Water with dead animals
- Water with algae/scum
- Milky/discolored water
- Water with chemical smell

**WATER STORAGE:**
- Use clean containers
- Keep covered
- Store in cool, dark place
- Rotate every 6 months
- 1 gallon per person per day

**DEHYDRATION SIGNS:**
Early:
- Thirst
- Dry mouth
- Dark urine
- Fatigue

Severe:
- No urination
- Sunken eyes
- Rapid heartbeat
- Confusion
- Unconsciousness

Treatment:
- Drink water slowly
- Add pinch of salt/sugar
- Seek medical help if severe
