**01 FIRE FUNDAMENTALS**

Category: Survival › Fire
---------------------------------------

**FIRE FUNDAMENTALS - LIFE-SAVING
HEAT**

**FIRE PROVIDES:**
- Warmth (prevents hypothermia)
- Water purification (boiling)
- Signaling (rescue)
- Morale (psychological survival)
- Cooking (nutrition)
- Predator deterrent
- Light (navigation, tasks)

**FIRE TRIANGLE - ALL THREE REQUIRED:**
1. HEAT (ignition source)
2. FUEL (wood, grass)
3. OXYGEN (air flow)

Remove any one = fire dies

**FUEL STAGES - CRITICAL TO
UNDERSTAND**

**STAGE 1: TINDER**
- Ignites from single spark or ember
- Burns hot and fast (1-2 minutes)
- Size: Thread to pencil lead

**BEST NATURAL TINDER:**
- Birch bark (peels off tree, burns
even wet!)
- Cedar bark (shred into fibers)
- Dry pine needles
- Dry grass (handful, fluffed)
- Cattail fluff
- Thistle down
- Crushed dry leaves

**BEST PROCESSED TINDER:**
- Char cloth (cotton burned in tin)
- Vaseline cotton balls (waterproof
fire starter)
- Dryer lint
- Shredded paper
- Steel wool (with battery)

**MAKING TINDER WHEN EVERYTHING IS
WET:**
- Scrape inner bark from dead branches
- Feather sticks (explained below)
- Resin from pine trees (highly
flammable!)
- Standing dead wood (center is dry)

---

**STAGE 2: KINDLING**
- Catches from burning tinder
- Burns 5-15 minutes
- Size: Pencil to finger thickness

**BEST KINDLING:**
- Small dead twigs (still on tree =
dry)
- Split pieces of larger wood
- Fatwood (resinous pine)
- Dry conifer branches

CRITICAL: Snap test
- Dead branch should SNAP cleanly
- If it bends = too wet
- Collect from off the ground when
possible

---

**STAGE 3: FUEL WOOD**
- Sustains fire for hours
- Size: Finger to wrist thickness for
1-4 hour fires
- Size: Arm thickness for overnight
fires

HARDWOOD vs SOFTWOOD:

HARDWOOD (Best for heat):
- Oak, maple, ash, hickory
- Burns hot and long
- Produces coals
- Better for cooking
- Harder to ignite

SOFTWOOD (Best for starting):
- Pine, fir, spruce, cedar
- Ignites easily
- Burns fast and hot
- More smoke
- Less coals
- Good for getting hardwood started

DEAD vs GREEN:

**DEAD WOOD:**
- Gray color
- Bark falling off
- Lighter weight
- Snaps easily
- Burns well

**GREEN WOOD:**
- Tight bark
- Heavier
- Bends before breaking
- Smokes heavily
- Won't sustain fire
- DON'T WASTE TIME - only use dead wood

**FINDING DRY WOOD IN RAIN:**

**1. STANDING DEAD TREES:**
- Look for trees with no bark
- No leaves/needles
- Split wood - center is dry!

**2. UNDERSIDE OF FALLEN LOGS:**
- Bottom is protected from rain
- Peel bark, scrape surface
- Inner wood is dry

**3. LOW BRANCHES ON EVERGREENS:**
- Protected by canopy above
- Dead branches still on tree
- Snap off at trunk

**4. INSIDE THICK BARK:**
- Split apart
- Core stays dry even in rain

**5. TREE RESIN/SAP:**
- Sticky, highly flammable
- Burns even when wet
- Look for "pitch wood" or "fatwood"
- Found in pine stumps/knots

---

**FEATHER STICKS - CRITICAL WET
WEATHER**
**SKILL**

WHAT: Wood shaved into thin curls,
still attached

**HOW TO MAKE:**
1. Find dry stick (wrist thickness)
2. Shave thin curls down stick with
knife
3. Don't cut curls off - leave attached
4. Create many thin shavings
5. Stand stick up, light curls at
bottom

**WHY IT WORKS:**
- Thin shavings ignite easily
- Many surfaces for fire to catch
- Solid wood provides sustained burn
- Transitions from tinder to kindling

**PRACTICE THIS SKILL!**
