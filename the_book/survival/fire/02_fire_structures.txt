**FIRE STRUCTURES - HOW TO LAY YOUR
**FIRE****

**TIPI/TEEPEE FIRE - BEST FOR
**STARTING****

**WHEN TO USE:**
- Getting fire started
- Quick heat
- Boiling water
- Windy conditions (protected center)

**HOW TO BUILD:**
1. Place tinder bundle in center
2. Lean small kindling in cone shape
around tinder
3. Leave door facing wind (oxygen)
4. Gradually add larger kindling
5. Light tinder through door

**ADVANTAGES:**
- Easy to light
- Fast heat
- Self-feeding (burns from center)

**DISADVANTAGES:**
- Burns fast
- Not long-lasting
- Need to rebuild often

**LOG CABIN FIRE - BEST FOR COOKING**

**WHEN TO USE:**
- Cooking
- Long-lasting fire
- Creating coals
- Stable platform

**HOW TO BUILD:**
1. Lay two logs parallel (12 inches
apart)
2. Lay two more perpendicular on top
3. Continue stacking (smaller at top)
4. Fill center with tipi fire
5. Light tipi - burns inward and down

**ADVANTAGES:**
- Long-lasting
- Flat top for pots
- Good airflow
- Stable

**DISADVANTAGES:**
- Uses more wood
- Takes longer to start

---

**LEAN-TO FIRE - WIND PROTECTION**

**WHEN TO USE:**
- Windy conditions
- Quick start needed
- Limited kindling

**HOW TO BUILD:**
1. Push stick in ground at 45° angle
2. Place tinder underneath
3. Lean kindling against stick
4. Light tinder
5. Add larger wood as it catches

**ADVANTAGES:**
- Wind protected
- Fast to build
- Efficient

**DAKOTA FIRE HOLE - STEALTH &
**EFFICIENCY****

**WHEN TO USE:**
- Need to hide fire (light/smoke)
- Very windy
- Limited wood
- Cooking

**HOW TO BUILD:**
1. Dig hole 12 inches deep, 12 inches
wide
2. Dig second hole 12 inches away
3. Tunnel connecting both holes at
bottom
4. Build fire in first hole
5. Second hole provides air (chimney
effect)

**ADVANTAGES:**
- Hidden (no light above ground)
- Less smoke
- Wind-proof
- Very hot (concentrated heat)
- Efficient (uses less wood)

**DISADVANTAGES:**
- Takes time to dig
- Need digging tool or hands
- Not good in rocky soil

---

**PLATFORM FIRE - WET GROUND**

**WHEN TO USE:**
- Wet/muddy ground
- Snow
- Marsh areas

**HOW TO BUILD:**
1. Lay platform of green logs
2. Build fire on top
3. Platform keeps fire off wet ground

CRITICAL: Use GREEN wood for platform
- Won't burn through quickly
- Provides stable base

---

**LONG FIRE - ALL NIGHT HEAT**

**WHEN TO USE:**
- Cold night
- Sleeping by fire
- Limited ability to tend fire

**HOW TO BUILD:**
1. Find 2-3 logs (8+ inches diameter, 6
feet long)
2. Lay parallel, 2 inches apart
3. Build fire between them
4. Logs burn slowly inward

Sleep parallel to logs with reflector
behind you

**ADVANTAGES:**
- Burns 6-8 hours
- Radiant heat along entire length
- Low maintenance

**DISADVANTAGES:**
- Need large logs
- Takes time to get going

---

**STAR FIRE - FUEL CONSERVATION**

**WHEN TO USE:**
- Limited wood supply
- Long-term survival
- Cooking

**HOW TO BUILD:**
1. Arrange 5-6 logs like star spokes
2. Ends meet in center
3. Build small fire in center
4. Push logs in as ends burn

**ADVANTAGES:**
- Very efficient
- Easy to control heat
- Conserves wood
- Self-regulating

---

**UPSIDE-DOWN FIRE - LONG LASTING**

**WHEN TO USE:**
- Overnight fire
- Minimal tending
- Dry conditions

**HOW TO BUILD:**
1. Layer largest logs at bottom
2. Each layer smaller
3. Kindling on top
4. Tinder at very top
5. Light from top

Burns downward slowly - can last hours
untended

**FIRE PLACEMENT TIPS:**

**DISTANCE FROM SHELTER:**
- 6-10 feet (not too close!)
- Enough to prevent sparks hitting
shelter
- Close enough for heat

**WIND DIRECTION:**
- Consider smoke direction
- Don't smoke yourself out
- Use for insect control (upwind of
bugs)

**REFLECTORS:**
- Rock wall or log wall behind fire
- 3-4 feet high
- Reflects heat toward you
- Can double warmth!

**ROCK RING:**
- Doesn't contain fire better (myth)
- Does prevent spread on dry ground
- Holds coals in organized area
- Provides mental boundary
