Category: Survival › Fire
---------------------------------------

**FIRE IGNITION METHODS - CREATING
HEAT**

**METHOD 1: FRICTION FIRES - NO TOOLS**

**BOW DRILL - MOST RELIABLE FRICTION**
**METHOD**

**PARTS NEEDED:**
1. Fireboard (baseboard)
2. Spindle (drill)
3. Bow
4. Handhold (top piece)
5. Cordage

**MATERIALS:**
- Wood should be dry, medium-soft
- Same wood species for spindle and
fireboard
- Good woods: Cottonwood, willow,
cedar, cypress, elm

**FIREBOARD:**
- 12-18 inches long
- 2-3 inches wide
- 3/4 inch thick
- Flat on both sides

**SPINDLE:**
- 8-10 inches long
- 3/4 inch diameter
- Straight
- Round
- Pointed at top, blunt at bottom

**BOW:**
- Slightly curved branch
- 2 feet long
- Strong (won't break)
- String with cordage

**HANDHOLD:**
- Piece of hard wood or rock
- Socket/depression for spindle top
- Can lubricate with pine sap or skin
oil

**CONSTRUCTION STEPS:**

**1. CUT NOTCH IN FIREBOARD:**
- Burn starter depression with spindle
- Cut V-notch to center of depression
(like pizza slice)
- Notch should be 1/8 of circle
- Coal will form at point of V

**2. PREPARE TINDER NEST:**
- Use finest, driest material
- Nest shape
- Loosely packed

**3. TECHNIQUE:**
- Kneel on right knee (right-handed)
- Left foot on fireboard
- Wrap bow string once around spindle
- Place spindle in depression
- Handhold on top of spindle
- Start slow - create friction groove
- Speed up - long, fast strokes
- Press down firmly
- Continue until smoking heavily
- Black powder accumulates in notch
- Keep going - will glow red (ember)

**4. EMBER TO FLAME:**
- Carefully transfer ember to tinder
nest
- Gently blow/wave
- Tinder will smoke, then ignite
- Add to kindling structure

**CRITICAL TIPS:**
- 80% of failures = poor materials
- Wood must be DRY
- Consistent speed and pressure
- Don't give up - takes practice
- First time may take 1 hour
- With practice: 5-10 minutes

**HAND DRILL - HARDER THAN BOW DRILL**

**MATERIALS:**
- Spindle: 18-24 inches long, 1/4 inch
diameter
- Fireboard: Same as bow drill

**TECHNIQUE:**
1. Place spindle in fireboard
depression
2. Roll spindle between palms
3. Press downward as you roll
4. Hands move down spindle
5. Quickly return to top and repeat
6. Very physically demanding

**EASIER WITH:**
- Two people alternating
- Dry conditions
- Softer woods
- Experience

---

**FIRE PLOUGH - ALTERNATIVE FRICTION**

**MATERIALS:**
- Softwood board with groove
- Hardwood stick to plough with

**TECHNIQUE:**
1. Cut groove in board
2. Rub stick up and down groove rapidly
3. Friction creates dust
4. Dust accumulates and ignites

EASIER in dry climates
HARDER than bow drill

---

**METHOD 2: FLINT AND STEEL**

**MATERIALS:**
- Flint (or other hard rock: quartz,
obsidian)
- Steel (knife back, steel striker)
- Char cloth (easiest to catch spark)

**TECHNIQUE:**
1. Hold flint in one hand
2. Place char cloth on flint
3. Strike down edge of flint with steel
4. Sparks land on char cloth
5. Char cloth glows red
6. Transfer to tinder nest
7. Blow gently to flame

**ADVANTAGES:**
- Works when wet (dry flint and steel
first)
- Reliable
- Fast with practice

**MAKING CHAR CLOTH:**
1. Cut 100% cotton into 2-inch squares
2. Place in metal tin with small hole
in lid
3. Put tin in fire
4. Smoke will pour out hole
5. When smoke stops = done
6. Let cool completely before opening
7. Black cloth = char cloth

METHOD 3: FERROCERIUM ROD (Survival
Tool)

MODERN EQUIVALENT to flint & steel

**TECHNIQUE:**
1. Place rod near tinder
2. Scrape down rod with steel (knife
back)
3. Hot sparks (3000°F) ignite tinder
4. Much easier than flint & steel

**WORKS WHEN WET!**
Can strike thousands of times

---

**METHOD 4: MAGNIFYING GLASS/LENS**

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- Bright sun
- Lens (magnifying glass, eyeglasses,
camera lens)
- Tinder

**TECHNIQUE:**
1. Hold lens over tinder
2. Focus sun into smallest point
3. Hold steady
4. Tinder will smoke and glow
5. Blow gently to flame

**ALTERNATIVES:**
- Bottom of clear water bottle (fill
with water = lens)
- Ice lens (shape clear ice into lens)
- Condom/balloon filled with water

**ONLY WORKS IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT**

---

**METHOD 5: BATTERY AND STEEL WOOL**

**MATERIALS:**
- 9V battery OR any battery
- Steel wool (0000 grade best)

**TECHNIQUE:**
1. Stretch steel wool slightly
2. Touch both battery terminals to wool
3. Wool ignites instantly
4. Place in tinder nest quickly

**ALSO WORKS:**
- Car battery + jumper cables touching
- Flashlight batteries in series + gum
wrapper

---

**METHOD 6: FIRE PISTON - COMPRESSION**
**IGNITION**

Advanced tool - creates heat through
rapid air compression

If you have one:
1. Place char cloth in cylinder
2. Rapidly slam piston down
3. Compression creates heat
4. Char cloth ignites

Expensive but reliable

---

**EMERGENCY IGNITION SOURCES:**

- Cigarette lighter (best - always
carry!)
- Waterproof matches (always carry!)
- Road flare
- Ammunition (remove bullet, use
powder)
- Camera flash (with steel wool)

---

**PRACTICE HIERARCHY:**

**EASIEST TO HARDEST:**
1. Lighter/matches (modern)
2. Ferrocerium rod
3. Flint and steel with char cloth
4. Magnifying glass (sunny day)
5. Battery and steel wool
6. Bow drill
7. Hand drill
8. Fire plough
