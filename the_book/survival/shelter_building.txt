**SHELTER BUILDING**

Category: Survival
---------------------------------------

Shelter Construction

Exposure kills faster than hunger.
Shelter protects from hypothermia,
hyperthermia, rain, wind, sun, insects.

RULE OF 3s:
- 3 minutes without air
- 3 hours without shelter (extreme
weather)
- 3 days without water
- 3 weeks without food

**SHELTER PRIORITIES:**
1. Location, location, location
2. Insulation from ground
3. Protection from elements
4. Size (smaller = warmer)

**SITE SELECTION:**
Good locations:
- Flat, elevated ground (drainage)
- Near water (not too close)
- Near firewood
- Protected from wind
- Dry ground
- South-facing (Northern Hemisphere)
- Natural windbreak

Avoid:
- Low spots (cold air sinks)
- Flash flood areas
- Dead standing trees (widowmakers)
- Animal trails
- Directly under trees (lightning)
- Rocky areas (snakes, scorpions)

**BASIC SHELTER TYPES:**
1. Debris Hut (best primitive):
Materials:
- Long ridgepole (8-10 ft)
- Ribs (arm-length sticks)
- Debris (leaves, grass, bark)

Construction:
1. Prop ridgepole 3-4 ft high
2. Lean ribs against both sides
3. Add lattice of small sticks
4. Pile debris 2-3 feet thick
5. Create small crawl-in entrance
6. Fill interior with dry leaves
7. Should be coffin-sized (small =
warm)

Insulation value:
- 2-3 ft debris = R-value ~30
- Stays dry inside even in rain
- Temperature neutral even at freezing

2. Lean-To:
Materials:
- 8-10 ft ridgepole
- Several support branches
- Covering material

Construction:
1. Lash ridgepole between trees
2. Lean branches at 45° angle
3. Add lattice of smaller sticks
4. Cover with bark, leaves, or tarp
5. Face away from wind
6. Build fire in front (reflector heat)
7. Not as warm as debris hut

3. A-Frame:
Materials:
- Ridge pole
- Ribs for both sides
- Covering

Construction:
1. Create ridgepole 3 ft high
2. Lean ribs on both sides (teepee
shape)
3. Add lattice
4. Cover with debris, tarp, or bark
5. Block both ends
6. Better insulation than lean-to

4. Tarp Shelter:
Various configurations:
- A-frame: cord between trees, tarp
over
- Lean-to: one side high, one low
- Flying tent: four corners staked
- Burrito: wrap yourself
- Diamond: one corner up, three down

Tips:
- Guy lines tight
- Pitch rain away from you
- Trenching around edges
- Ventilation to prevent condensation

5. Snow Cave:
(Winter survival)
Materials needed:
- Snow drift 6+ ft deep
- Shovel or improvised tool

Construction:
1. Dig into side of drift
2. Create entrance tunnel
3. Hollow out sleeping chamber
4. Make chamber higher than entrance
(warm air rises, cold sinks)
5. Poke ventilation hole in roof
6. Create sleeping platform
7. Block entrance partially
8. Temperature stays ~32°F (0°C)
even when outside is -40°F

6. Quinzhee (snow hut):
1. Pile snow 6-8 ft high
2. Let settle 2-3 hours
3. Insert 12" sticks all around
4. Hollow out interior
5. Stop when you hit sticks
6. Poke vent hole
7. Takes 3-4 hours to build

**GROUND INSULATION:**
Critical! Body loses heat to ground
fast.
Materials (bottom to top):
1. Raised platform (if possible)
2. Thick layer of leaves/pine needles
3. Pine boughs
4. Sleeping pad/more debris
5. Keep dry at all costs

Without insulation = hypothermia

**BEDDING:**
- Fill debris hut with dry leaves
- Pine boughs make good mattress
- Grass, cattails work too
- Stuff clothes with dry leaves
- Create debris sleeping bag

**WEATHERPROOFING:**
Rain:
- Steep roof pitch
- Thick debris layer
- Overlapping bark like shingles
- Tarp if available
- Check for leaks before dark

Wind:
- Small entrance
- Face away from prevail wind
- Windbreak wall
- Fill gaps with debris

Cold:
- Small space
- Ground insulation
- Body heat trap
- Fill air gaps
- Cover entrance at night

Heat:
- Shade
- Ventilation
- Elevation (breeze)
- Near water
- Light-colored materials

**SIGNALING FROM SHELTER:**
- Build in visible location
- Create SOS with rocks
- Have signal fire ready
- Orange tarp visible from air
- Smoke during day
- Fire at night

**LONG-TERM SHELTER:**
Improvements:
- Door/flap
- Fire reflector wall
- Drying rack
- Storage area
- Cooking area
- Waste disposal site
- Water collection
- Signaling area

**EMERGENCY SHELTER:**
If caught out suddenly:
- Get out of wind immediately
- Use natural features (cave, overhang)
- Pile debris against log
- Crawl inside debris pile
- Huddle in hollow
- Wrap in tarp/plastic
- Get off ground
- Something is better than nothing
