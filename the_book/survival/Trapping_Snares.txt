**TRAPPING AND SNARING**

**COMPLETE TRAPPING GUIDE**

**OVERVIEW:**
Trapping is often more effective than
hunting as traps work 24/7 while you
perform other tasks. Passive food
gathering.

**LEGAL NOTICE:**
Check local regulations. This is for
survival situations only.

**TRAPPING ADVANTAGES:**
- Works while you sleep
- Low energy expenditure
- Multiple traps = more chances
- No weapon needed
- Silent operation
- Catches wary animals

**TRAP PLACEMENT:**

**LOCATION SCOUTING:**
Look for:
- Game trails (worn paths)
- Water sources
- Feeding areas
- Burrow entrances
- Rub marks on trees
- Fresh droppings
- Tracks in mud

**BEST LOCATIONS:**
- Narrow passes
- Between obstacles
- Near den entrances
- Along fences/walls
- Water crossings
- Food sources

**SIGNS OF ACTIVITY:**
- Fresh tracks
- Warm droppings
- Recently eaten plants
- Disturbed ground
- Hair on branches
- Active burrows

**BASIC SNARE:**

**SIMPLE LOOP SNARE:**
Materials:
- Wire (24-gauge brass) OR
- Strong cord/fishing line
- Anchor point

Construction:
1. Make small loop at one end
2. Thread other end through loop
3. Create 6-8 inch circle
4. Secure to anchor
5. Position on trail

**SIZING:**
Rabbit: 4 inch diameter
Squirrel: 3 inch diameter
Larger game: 8-12 inches

**HEIGHT:**
- 1 fist above ground (rabbit)
- Head height for animal
- Test with stick first

**DEADFALL TRAPS:**

**FIGURE-4 DEADFALL:**
Components:
- Vertical stick (notched)
- Horizontal stick (notched)
- Diagonal stick (trigger)
- Heavy flat rock/log

Assembly:
1. Cut notches in sticks
2. Fit together in figure-4
3. Balance rock on horizontal
4. Bait on trigger
5. Animal triggers = rock falls

**PAIUTE DEADFALL:**
More sensitive trigger:
- Uses cordage
- Hair-trigger action
- Easier to set
- Catches small game

**MATERIALS:**
- Y-shaped stake
- Short toggle stick
- Bait stick
- Cordage
- Heavy rock

**SPRING SNARES:**

**CONCEPT:**
Uses bent sapling to:
- Snap animal upward
- Breaks neck (humane)
- Keeps off ground (safe from
scavengers)
- Easy to spot from distance

**CONSTRUCTION:**
1. Find flexible sapling
2. Bend down to trail
3. Attach trigger mechanism
4. Set snare loop
5. Bait or position on trail

**TRIGGER TYPES:**
- Toggle trigger
- Hook trigger
- Figure-4 variant
- Commercial triggers (if available)

**PIT TRAP:**

**FOR LARGER ANIMALS:**
1. Dig deep pit (6+ feet)
2. Make walls vertical
3. Sharpen stakes (optional)
4. Cover with light material
5. Camouflage with debris

**WARNING:**
Dangerous to humans too!
- Mark trap location
- Remember where set
- Check frequently
- Fill in when done

**BOTTLE/CONTAINER TRAP:**

**FOR SMALL ANIMALS:**
Works for:
- Mice
- Rats
- Small fish
- Insects

Method:
1. Plastic bottle/container
2. Cut hole in side
3. Bait inside
4. Easy entry, hard exit
5. Check daily

**FISH TRAP:**

**BASKET WEAVE TRAP:**
1. Weave cone from sticks
2. Narrow end inward
3. Place in stream
4. Bait inside
5. Fish enter, can't exit

**TIDAL TRAP:**
At ocean:
1. Build rock semicircle
2. Open end faces sea
3. High tide fills
4. Low tide traps fish

**BAIT SELECTION:**

**FOR CARNIVORES:**
- Meat scraps
- Fish
- Entrails
- Eggs
- Blood

**FOR HERBIVORES:**
- Fresh greens
- Vegetables
- Seeds
- Nuts
- Fruit
- Salt

**FOR OMNIVORES:**
- Peanut butter
- Berries
- Grains
- Insects
- Various foods

**SCENT LURES:**
- Urine (from prey species)
- Gland scents
- Fish oil
- Rotted meat
- Anise oil

**TRAP MAINTENANCE:**

**CHECKING SCHEDULE:**
Check traps:
- Morning (early)
- Evening (before dark)
- Minimum twice daily
- More often in warm weather

**WHY FREQUENT CHECKS:**
- Prevent suffering
- Stop scavenger theft
- Meat stays fresh
- Reset triggered traps
- Adjust ineffective sets

**RESETTING:**
- Clean away human scent
- Replace disturbed material
- Adjust trigger sensitivity
- Move if no success after 2 days
- Try different bait

**CAMOUFLAGE:**

**NATURAL APPEARANCE:**
- Use local materials
- Don't disturb area much
- Cover shiny wire
- Match surroundings
- Minimize human scent

**SCENT CONTROL:**
- Wash hands with ash
- Boil wire/cord
- Don't smoke near traps
- Wear gloves
- Use dead vegetation

**PROCESSING CATCH:**

**HUMANE DISPATCH:**
If animal alive:
- Quick neck break OR
- Heavy blow to head
- Minimize suffering
- Be prepared mentally

**IMMEDIATE FIELD DRESSING:**
1. Bleed animal
2. Remove entrails
3. Cool quickly
4. Protect from flies
5. Return to camp

**SAVE USEFUL PARTS:**
- Hide (clothing, cordage)
- Sinew (thread, bowstring)
- Bones (tools, needles)
- Organs (some edible)
- Fat (waterproofing, fuel)

**MULTI-TRAP SYSTEM:**

**TRAPLINE:**
Set multiple traps:
- 10-20 traps = better odds
- Check all daily
- Near camp (easy access)
- Different trap types
- Various locations

**RECORD KEEPING:**
Remember:
- Which traps work
- Successful locations
- Best bait
- Animal patterns
- Seasonal changes

**EFFICIENCY:**
- Trap while doing other tasks
- Sleep while traps work
- More reliable than hunting
- Less energy spent
- Consistent food source

**SAFETY WARNINGS:**

**DANGEROUS TRAPS:**
- Spring snares can injure humans
- Deadfalls can crush
- Pit traps are hazards
- Always mark locations
- Warn others in group

**LEGAL CONCERNS:**
- Illegal in most places
(non-emergency)
- Property rights
- Protected species
- Trap regulations
- Hunting seasons

**CHILDREN/PETS:**
- Keep away from trap areas
- Explain dangers
- Supervise closely
- Deactivate when not needed

**IMPROVISED MATERIALS:**

**CORDAGE:**
- Shoelaces
- Belt
- Clothing strips
- Plant fibers
- Animal sinew

**WIRE SUBSTITUTES:**
- Braided fishing line
- Strong natural fiber
- Metal from equipment
- Twisted wire
- Cable

**TRIGGER MECHANISMS:**
- Carved from wood
- Bone pieces
- Metal bits
- Practice carving

**SEASONAL CONSIDERATIONS:**

**WINTER:**
- Animals more desperate
- Follow tracks in snow
- Set near dens
- Food scarce = better bait response

**SUMMER:**
- More food available
- Animals less desperate
- Check traps more often (heat)
- More scent attractants needed

**YEAR-ROUND:**
- Adjust to animal behavior
- Different species active
- Migrate to food sources
- Adapt techniques

**PRACTICE:**

**LEARN BEFORE EMERGENCY:**
- Build traps at home
- Study mechanisms
- Test triggers
- Learn knots
- Practice placement

**ETHICS:**
- Quick kill preferred
- Minimize suffering
- Use all parts
- Respect wildlife
- Gratitude for sacrifice
