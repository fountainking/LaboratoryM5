Fire Starting & Maintenance

Fire provides: warmth, water
purification,
cooking, signaling, protection from
animals, and morale boost.

FIRE TRIANGLE (all 3 needed):
1. Fuel (tinder, kindling, logs)
2. Oxygen (air flow)
3. Heat (ignition source)

Remove any one element = fire goes out

TINDER (catches spark):
Natural:
- Dry grass, leaves
- Pine needles
- Birch bark (best!)
- Cedar bark (shredded)
- Cattail fluff
- Milkweed silk
- Dried moss
- Fatwood (pine with resin)
- Charred cloth
- Fine wood shavings

Man-made:
- Cotton balls + petroleum jelly
- Dryer lint
- Paper
- Cardboard
- Steel wool

KINDLING (small sticks):
- Pencil-thick twigs
- Small dry branches
- Feather sticks (carved)
- Bamboo splits
- Dead pine branches
- Must be dry and snap easily

FUEL (larger wood):
- Arm-thick branches
- Logs
- Hardwood burns longer
- Softwood burns hotter/faster
- Dead standing wood (best)
- Avoid green wood (smoky, won't burn
well)

**IGNITION METHODS:**
1. Matches:
- Waterproof matches best
- Strike-anywhere useful
- Store in waterproof container

2. Lighter:
- Butane lighter reliable
- Works when wet (let dry)
- Flint lasts after fuel gone

3. Ferro Rod (ferrocerium):
- Scrape with knife spine
- Creates 3000°F sparks
- Works when wet
- Thousands of strikes
- Aim sparks at tinder

4. Magnifying Glass:
- Focus sun on tinder
- Needs bright sunlight
- Hold steady 12-18"
- Creates ember in 30-60 sec

5. Flint & Steel:
- Strike steel against flint/quartz
- Sparks land on char cloth
- Blow gently to ember
- Traditional method

6. Bow Drill (friction):
Most reliable primitive method

Parts:
- Bow: flexible stick + cordage
- Drill: straight stick (palm-thick)
- Fireboard: flat softwood
- Handhold: wood with socket
- Tinder nest

Technique:
1. Cut notch in fireboard
2. Place drill in notch
3. Wrap bow string once around drill
4. Press handhold on top of drill
5. Bow back and forth rapidly
6. Creates friction heat
7. Ember forms in notch
8. Drop into tinder nest
9. Blow gently to flame

Best woods: willow, cottonwood, cedar

FIRE LAYS (structures):
1. Teepee:
- Lean kindling in cone shape
- Tinder in center
- Good for quick fire
- Burns hot and fast

2. Log Cabin:
- Stack kindling in square layers
- Tinder in center
- Good airflow
- Burns evenly

3. Lean-To:
- Large log as windbreak
- Lean kindling against it
- Tinder underneath
- Good in wind

4. Star Fire:
- Logs in star pattern
- Push logs in as they burn
- Good for long-term fire
- Uses less wood

5. Dakota Fire Hole:
- Dig two connected holes
- Fire in one, air flows from other
- Concealed, efficient
- Good in wind

**STARTING FIRE:**
1. Gather ALL materials first
2. Prepare tinder nest
3. Create spark/flame
4. Place in tinder
5. Blow gently (add oxygen)
6. Add kindling gradually
7. Add larger fuel
8. Maintain airflow

**WET CONDITIONS:**
- Look for dead standing wood
- Check under logs, rocks
- Use inner bark (dry)
- Split wood (dry inside)
- Make feather sticks
- Use extra tinder
- Build raised platform
- Use birch bark (burns when wet)

**FIRE MAINTENANCE:**
- Keep fuel nearby
- Protect from rain (tarp)
- Don't let it die (hard to restart)
- Bank fire at night:
* Cover with ash
* Add large logs
* Will smolder till morning
- Keep water nearby for safety

**SIGNALING WITH FIRE:**
Smoke signals:
- Add green branches for white smoke
- Add rubber/oil for black smoke
- Three fires in triangle (SOS)
- Visible for miles

**FIRE SAFETY:**
- Clear area of flammable material
- Keep 10ft diameter clear
- Dig fire pit if possible
- Never leave unattended
- Extinguish completely when done:
* Pour water
* Stir ashes
* Feel for heat
* Repeat until cold

**COOKING FIRE:**
- Let burn to coals (hotter, smokeless)
- Use rocks to support pot
- Keep wood to side, rake coals

**WARMING FIRE:**
- Build larger, hotter fire
- Reflect heat with log/rock wall
- Position upwind of shelter
