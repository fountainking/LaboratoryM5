**01 SHELTER PRIORITIES**

Category: Survival › Shelter
---------------------------------------

**SHELTER - YOUR FIRST PRIORITY**

**WHEN SHELTER COMES BEFORE WATER:**
- Temperature below 50°F (10°C) and wet
- Temperature below 32°F (0°C)
- Temperature above 95°F (35°C) in
desert
- High winds (windchill can kill in
hours)
- Heavy rain/snow

HYPOTHERMIA can kill in 3 hours.
EXPOSURE can kill faster than
dehydration.

**SHELTER LOCATION - CRITICAL
FACTORS:**

**AVOID:**
- Valley bottoms (cold air sinks, frost
pockets)
- Exposed ridges (wind, lightning)
- Under dead trees (widowmakers)
- Dry creek beds (flash floods)
- Game trails (animal traffic)
- Avalanche zones (steep slopes with
recent snow)

**LOOK FOR:**
- Natural windbreaks (rock walls, dense
trees)
- High enough to avoid cold air
drainage
- Low enough to avoid wind exposure
- Near water (but not too close -
insects, animals)
- Dry ground (critical!)
- South-facing slope (Northern
hemisphere - more sun)
- North-facing slope (Southern
hemisphere)
- Natural materials for building

**GROUND INSULATION:**
Your body loses heat 25 times faster on
cold ground than in cold air.

**MINIMUM INSULATION:**
- 6 inches of dry leaves, grass, or
pine needles
- OR sleeping mat
- OR layer of bark/wood
- Never sleep directly on ground in
cold weather

**EMERGENCY INSULATION:**
- Stuff clothing with dry leaves/grass
- Newspaper (excellent insulator)
- Bark pieces
- Dry moss
- Pine boughs

**WIND PROTECTION:**
Wind speed of 10 mph can make 40°F feel
like 32°F
Wind speed of 20 mph can make 40°F feel
like 25°F

ALWAYS build shelter with back to
prevailing wind
