**02 DEBRIS HUT**

Category: Survival › Shelter
---------------------------------------

**DEBRIS HUT - BEST SOLO SURVIVAL
SHELTER**

**WHY IT'S BEST:**
- Built from natural materials only
- Excellent insulation
- Waterproof when built right
- Retains body heat
- No tools required (better with knife)

**LOCATION:**
- Two trees 6-8 feet apart, OR
- One fallen tree, OR
- Large rock for ridgepole support

**CONSTRUCTION STEPS:**

**STEP 1 - RIDGEPOLE:**
- Strong branch 9-12 feet long
- 3-4 inches diameter
- Lean at 45° angle between supports
- Height at entrance: 3 feet (just
enough to crawl in)
- Low = better heat retention

**STEP 2 - RIBBING:**
- Branches 6-8 feet long
- Lean against ridgepole on both sides
- Space 6 inches apart
- Angle: 45-50 degrees
- Create A-frame shape
- Extend 2-3 feet beyond foot of
shelter (wind protection)

**STEP 3 - LATTICE:**
- Small sticks perpendicular to ribs
- Weave if possible
- Creates mesh to hold debris
- Prevents debris from falling through

**STEP 4 - DEBRIS LAYER 1**
(Waterproofing):
- Large leaves (best)
- Bark slabs
- Grass bundles
- Layer like shingles, bottom to top
- Each layer overlaps 50%
- Completely cover framework

STEP 5 - DEBRIS LAYER 2 (Insulation):
- Pile leaves, pine needles, grass
- MINIMUM 2 feet thick all around
- 3 feet thick = much better
- More = warmer
- Can't be too thick!

STEP 6 - FINAL LAYER (Structure):
- Branches over debris
- Prevents wind from blowing debris
away
- Small logs work well

**STEP 7 - DOOR PLUG:**
- Bundle of debris/leaves
- Must completely seal entrance
- Critical for heat retention!
- Pull in after you enter

**INTERIOR:**
- Fill floor with 12+ inches of dry
leaves/grass
- Fluff it up
- You'll compress it when you lie down
- Restock each evening

**SIZE:**
Make it SMALL!
- Just big enough to lie down
- Your body heat warms the space
- Bigger = colder
- Should feel cramped

**COMPLETED HUT WILL:**
- Look like a giant pile of leaves
- Be waterproof in heavy rain
- Keep you warm in freezing temps
- Retain heat from body only (no fire
needed)

**TESTING:**
- Lie inside
- Pull door plug closed
- Within 30 minutes should feel warm
- If not, add more debris layers

**ADVANCED:**
- Dig shallow pit in floor (cold air
sinks)
- Line pit with hot rocks before bed
- Cover rocks with dirt, then bedding

**SPRING/SUMMER VERSION:**
- Less debris (1 foot layer)
- Better ventilation
- Focus on waterproofing, not
insulation

**TIME TO BUILD:**
- First time: 4-6 hours
- With practice: 2-3 hours
- Worth every minute when temperature
drops!
