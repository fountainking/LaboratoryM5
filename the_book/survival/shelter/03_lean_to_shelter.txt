**03 LEAN TO SHELTER**

Category: Survival › Shelter
---------------------------------------

**LEAN-TO SHELTER - QUICK BUILD**

**BEST FOR:**
- Short-term shelter (1-3 days)
- Mild weather
- When you have fire for heat
- Wind protection with fire

**NOT GOOD FOR:**
- Cold weather without fire
- Heavy rain (unless well-built)
- Retaining heat (one side open)

**CONSTRUCTION:**

**STEP 1 - LOCATION:**
- Find two trees 6-8 feet apart
- OR one long fallen tree
- Natural wind break behind

**STEP 2 - RIDGEPOLE:**
- Strong branch 8-10 feet long
- Lash between trees at 4-5 feet high
- OR lean against single support

**STEP 3 - RIBBING:**
- Branches 6-8 feet long
- Lean against ridgepole at 45° angle
- Space 4-6 inches apart
- All on same side (back to wind)

**STEP 4 - THATCHING:**
BOTTOM TO TOP (like roof shingles):

Layer 1 (Bottom):
- Long grass bundles OR
- Pine boughs OR
- Large leaves
- Tie/weave to ribs

Layer 2:
- Overlap Layer 1 by 50%
- Continue to top

Continue layers until top of ridge

**THICKNESS:**
- Minimum 6 inches of material
- 12 inches = much better waterproofing

**STEP 5 - BACK WALL:**
- Build wall of stacked branches behind
ridgepole
- Weave smaller branches through
- Add debris/leaves
- Blocks wind from behind

**STEP 6 - FIRE REFLECTOR:**
CRITICAL for warmth!

Build wall 4-6 feet in front of
shelter:
- Stack logs or rocks 3-4 feet high
- 6-8 feet wide
- Angled slightly toward shelter

Build fire between shelter and
reflector

**FIRE REFLECTS HEAT INTO SHELTER!**

**STEP 7 - BEDDING:**
- 6-12 inches of dry leaves/grass
- Raises you off cold ground
- Fluff before sleeping

**ADVANCED LEAN-TO:**

**DOUBLE LEAN-TO:**
- Two lean-tos facing each other
- Fire in middle
- Excellent heat retention
- Good for 2-3 people

**STONE BACKING:**
- Build lean-to in front of rock wall
- Rock reflects heat
- Retains warmth after fire dies

**PITCHED ROOF:**
- Add side walls
- Creates full triangle
- Much better rain protection
- Closer to debris hut design

**WITH TARP:**
- Drape tarp over ridgepole
- Stake bottom to ground
- STILL add natural materials
(insulation + camouflage)
- Tarp alone = cold at night

**TIME TO BUILD:**
- Basic: 1-2 hours
- Waterproof: 3-4 hours
- With fire reflector: Add 1 hour

**FIRE MANAGEMENT:**
- Keep fire small and constant
- Large fire = too hot, wastes wood
- Goal: steady heat all night
- Collect 3x more wood than you think
you need
- Hardwood burns longer
- Softwood starts easier
