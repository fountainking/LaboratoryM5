**SNOW SHELTERS - COLD WEATHER
**SURVIVAL****

QUINZHEE (Snow Cave) - BEST WINTER
**SHELTER**

**ADVANTAGES:**
- Warmer than debris hut in deep snow
- Interior can be 40°F warmer than
outside
- Windproof
- Quiet
- Uses abundant material (snow)

**LOCATION:**
- Flat area or slight depression
- Deep snow (4+ feet)
- Away from avalanche danger
- Not under snow-loaded trees

**CONSTRUCTION:**

**STEP 1 - PILE SNOW:**
- Shovel/push snow into pile
- 8-10 feet diameter
- 6-7 feet high
- Let consolidate 1-2 hours (critical!)
- Snow bonds and strengthens

**STEP 2 - INSERT STICKS:**
- Push 12-inch sticks into pile
- All around, pointing to center
- These are your thickness guides
- When you hit stick tip = stop digging

**STEP 3 - DIG ENTRANCE:**
- Start on downwind side
- Dig tunnel at upward angle
- Tunnel: 2-3 feet long
- Keep entrance small (conserves heat)

**STEP 4 - HOLLOW OUT INTERIOR:**
- Reach in and dig upward
- Create dome shape
- Stop when you hit stick tips
- Walls should be 12 inches thick
minimum
- Dome shape = strongest

**STEP 5 - SLEEPING PLATFORM:**
- Make elevated bench inside
- 18-24 inches above entrance
- Cold air sinks to entrance
- You sleep warm above it

**STEP 6 - VENTILATION (CRITICAL!):**
- Poke fist-sized hole in roof
- Essential for air exchange
- Carbon dioxide sinks, fresh air
enters
- Check vent hole regularly
- Can be blocked by snow

**STEP 7 - DOOR PLUG:**
- Block entrance with pack or snow
block
- Leave small gap at bottom (air
intake)

**INTERIOR TIPS:**
- Smooth ceiling (prevents drips)
- Can carve shelves in walls
- Candle provides light + small heat
- Sleep with head toward entrance

TIME TO BUILD: 3-4 hours

**WARNING SIGNS:**
- Headache = poor ventilation (CO2
buildup)
- Difficulty breathing = check vent!
- Dripping ceiling = too warm, open
door

**TEMPERATURE:**
- Outside: -20°F
- Inside: +20°F to +32°F
- Your body heat warms it!

**SNOW TRENCH - EMERGENCY FAST
**SHELTER****

FOR: Quick emergency shelter in deep
snow

**CONSTRUCTION:**
1. Dig trench: 7 feet long, 3 feet
wide, 3 feet deep
2. Lay branches/skis across top
3. Cover with tarp/poncho
4. Pile 12+ inches snow on top
5. Block ends with snow/packs
6. Insulate floor with pine boughs

TIME: 30-60 minutes

EFFECTIVE to -10°F with good insulation

---

**TREE WELL SHELTER - EMERGENCY**

WARNING: Risk of tree well suffocation
- use only if necessary

**LOCATION:**
- Base of large evergreen tree
- Natural snow-free depression
- Branches overhead for roof

**CONSTRUCTION:**
1. Dig deeper into well
2. Add floor insulation (boughs)
3. Use fallen branches to create roof
frame
4. Cover with snow blocks
5. Leave vent hole

Better than nothing, but less safe than
quinzhee

**IGLOO - BEST BUT REQUIRES SKILL**

Requires:
- Right snow consistency (packable, not
powder)
- Snow saw or knife
- Experience (practice first!)

Brief steps:
1. Cut snow blocks (18"x12"x6")
2. Arrange in circle, spiral upward
3. Tilt blocks inward
4. Create dome
5. Add entrance tunnel
6. Vent hole at top

Takes practice but BEST cold weather
shelter
Can be 60°F warmer inside than outside

**PRACTICE IN NON-EMERGENCY FIRST!**

---

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
- Always ventilate snow shelters
- Sleep with head toward door
- Keep shovel inside (in case buried)
- Mark shelter entrance with stick/pole
- Check vent hole before sleeping
- Never use fire inside snow shelter
(melting!)
