**HEXAGRAM 64: BEFORE COMPLETION**
Wei Ji

Fire over Water

aaa
a a

KEYWORD: Not yet complete, potential,
care

**THE JUDGMENT:**
Before completion. Success. But if the
little fox crosses the water before his
tail is across, there is nothing that
would further. Almost there but not
yet. Final stretch critical. Don't
rush. Careful completion. One more push
needed.

**THE IMAGE:**
Fire above water: before completion.
The superior person is careful in
differentiating things.

**INTERPRETATION:**
On the verge of completion but not
there yet. Like fox crossing frozen
river - one careless step and you fall
through. Stay focused. Careful now.
Victory is close but premature
celebration brings failure. Finish
strong.

**HOW TO USE THIS HEXAGRAM:**
This hexagram appears when you need its
particular wisdom. Meditate on the
judgment and image. Apply the
interpretation to your current question
or situation.

The I Ching speaks to the moment. What
in your life right now resonates with
this hexagram's teaching?
