KEYWORD: Observation, meditation,
clarity

**THE JUDGMENT:**
Contemplation. The ablution has been

Be an example. Inner clarity radiates.

**THE IMAGE:**
Wind blows over the earth:
contemplation. Ancient kings visited
all regions to observe the people.

**INTERPRETATION:**
Time for observation not action. Step
back and see the whole. Meditate.
Contemplate. Others watch you - be
mindful of your example. Clarity comes
from stillness. Understand before you
act.

**HOW TO USE THIS HEXAGRAM:**
This hexagram appears when you need its
particular wisdom. Meditate on the
judgment and image. Apply the
interpretation to your current question
or situation.
