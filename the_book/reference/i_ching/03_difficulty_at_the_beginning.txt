KEYWORD: Initial difficulties, birth

**THE JUDGMENT:**
Difficulty at the beginning works
supreme success. Persevere. Do not
undertake anything hastily. Appoint
helpers. Chaos before order. New
beginnings are hard. Persist through
confusion.

**THE IMAGE:**
Clouds and thunder: difficulty at the
beginning. The superior person brings
order out of confusion.

**INTERPRETATION:**
Starting something new brings chaos.
This is natural. Don't give up. Seek
help from others. Small steps forward.
Organization emerges from disorder.
Birth is always difficult.

**HOW TO USE THIS HEXAGRAM:**
This hexagram appears when you need its
particular wisdom. Meditate on the
judgment and image. Apply the
interpretation to your current question
or situation.
