**HEXAGRAM 6: CONFLICT**
Song

Heaven over Water

aaa
a a

KEYWORD: Disagreement, opposition,
legal matters

**THE JUDGMENT:**
Conflict. You are sincere but
obstructed. Halting halfway brings good
fortune. Going through brings
misfortune. Seek mediation. Don't force
your way. Compromise better than
victory.

**THE IMAGE:**
Heaven and water go their opposite
ways: conflict. The superior person
plans the beginning carefully.

**INTERPRETATION:**
Opposition arises. Don't escalate. Seek
middle ground. Legal battles are
exhausting even when won. Prevention
better than confrontation. Step back
and reassess.

**HOW TO USE THIS HEXAGRAM:**
This hexagram appears when you need its
particular wisdom. Meditate on the
judgment and image. Apply the
interpretation to your current question
or situation.

The I Ching speaks to the moment. What
in your life right now resonates with
this hexagram's teaching?
