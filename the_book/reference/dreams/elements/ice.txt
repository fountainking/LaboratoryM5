ICE

Category: Elements

Frozen emotions, coldness,
preservation. Ice = emotional shutdown.
Melting = thawing. Slipping = unstable
footing. Frozen in ice = stuck.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
