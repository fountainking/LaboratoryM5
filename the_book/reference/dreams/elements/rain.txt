**RAIN**

Category: Elements

Cleansing, emotions, renewal. Gentle
rain = emotional release. Storm =
turmoil. Drought ending = relief.
Inside during rain = protected from
emotions.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
