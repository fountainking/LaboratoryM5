**DROUGHT**

Category: Elements

Emotional dryness, scarcity,
barrenness. Drought = lack of emotional
nourishment. Thirst = need for
connection. Desert = isolation.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
