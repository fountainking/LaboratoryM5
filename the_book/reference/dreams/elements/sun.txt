SUN

Category: Elements

Consciousness, vitality, clarity. Sun =
awareness and life force. Rising = new
beginning. Setting = ending. Bright =
clarity. Hidden = confusion.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
