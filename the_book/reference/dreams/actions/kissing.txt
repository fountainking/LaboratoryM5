**KISSING**

Category: Actions

Connection, intimacy, approval. Who you
kiss matters. Stranger = accepting
unknown. Wrong person = misplaced
affection. Passionate = desire.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
