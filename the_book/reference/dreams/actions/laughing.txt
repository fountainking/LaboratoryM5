**LAUGHING**

Category: Actions

Joy, release, coping mechanism.
Laughing = processing emotions.
Uncontrollable laughter = hysteria or
defense. Happy laughter = joy.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
