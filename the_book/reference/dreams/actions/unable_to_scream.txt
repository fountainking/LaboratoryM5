**UNABLE TO SCREAM**

Category: Actions

Powerlessness, suppressed emotions,
voicelessness. Can't speak = feeling
unheard in waking life. Throat issues =
communication blocks.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
