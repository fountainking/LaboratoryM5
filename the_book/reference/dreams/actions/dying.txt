**DYING**

Category: Actions

Endings, transformation, rebirth. Death
rarely means physical death. Represents
end of phase and new beginning. Who
dies matters.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
