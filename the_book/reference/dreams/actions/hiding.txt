**HIDING**

Category: Actions

Avoidance, shame, protection. Hiding =
avoiding confrontation. Can't find
hiding spot = nowhere to run. Found =
secrets revealed.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
