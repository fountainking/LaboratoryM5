**SWIMMING**

Category: Actions

Navigating emotions, going with flow,
immersion. Swimming = emotional
navigation. Easy swimming = handling
feelings well. Struggling = emotional
difficulty.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
