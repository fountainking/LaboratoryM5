**RUNNING**

Category: Actions

Escape, pursuit of goals, urgency.
Running from = avoidance. Running
toward = pursuing goals. Unable to run
= feeling stuck.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
