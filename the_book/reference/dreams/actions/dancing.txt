**DANCING**

Category: Actions

Expression, freedom, celebration.
Dancing = expressing yourself. Graceful
= confidence. Awkward =
self-consciousness. Partner dance =
relationship harmony.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
