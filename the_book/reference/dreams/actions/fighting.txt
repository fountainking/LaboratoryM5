**FIGHTING**

Category: Actions

Internal conflict, standing up for
self, aggression. Fighting = inner or
outer conflicts. Winning = overcoming.
Losing = giving up power.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
