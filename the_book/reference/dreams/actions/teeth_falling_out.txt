**TEETH FALLING OUT**

Category: Actions

Anxiety, powerlessness, communication
issues. Teeth falling = loss of control
or fear of aging. May indicate feeling
powerless in situation.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
