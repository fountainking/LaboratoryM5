**BEING CHASED**

Category: Actions

Avoidance, fear, running from issues.
Being chased = running from something
in waking life. Face the chaser to
resolve. What chases you reveals what
you avoid.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
