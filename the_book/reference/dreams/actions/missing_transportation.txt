**MISSING TRANSPORTATION**

Category: Actions

Missed opportunities, lack of control,
timing issues. Missing bus/train =
feeling life passing by. Running late =
time pressure.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
