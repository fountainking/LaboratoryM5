**EATING**

Category: Actions

Nourishment, consumption, taking in.
What you eat matters. Junk food = empty
experiences. Healthy food = good
choices. Overeating = excess.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
