**TAKING TEST**

Category: Actions

Being judged, fear of failure,
self-evaluation. Tests = feeling
evaluated or unprepared. Unprepared =
imposter syndrome. Passing =
confidence.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
