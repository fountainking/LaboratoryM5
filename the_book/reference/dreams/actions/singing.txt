**SINGING**

Category: Actions

Expression, joy, communication. Singing
= expressing feelings. Beautiful voice
= confident expression. Can't sing =
feeling voiceless.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
