**CHILD**

Category: People

Inner child, innocence, potential.
Children represent your younger self.
Happy child = healed wounds. Hurt child
= childhood trauma needs attention.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
