**DOCTOR**

Category: People

Healing, health concerns, care. Doctors
symbolize need for healing. Surgery =
deep change needed. Diagnosis =
recognizing issue.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
