**FRIEND**

Category: People

Aspects of self, support, relationship
quality. Friends represent parts of
you. Fighting = internal conflict. Lost
friend = lost part of self.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
