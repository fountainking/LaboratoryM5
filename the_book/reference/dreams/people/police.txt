**POLICE**

Category: People

Authority, rules, conscience. Police
represent internal moral code. Arrest =
feeling guilt. Chase = avoiding
consequences.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
