**FATHER**

Category: People

Authority, protection, structure.
Father symbolizes rules and guidance.
Angry father = authority issues. Absent
father = need for guidance.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
