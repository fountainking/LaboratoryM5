**BABY**

Category: People

New beginnings, vulnerability,
potential. Babies represent pure
potential and new starts. Crying baby =
neglected project. Sick baby =
vulnerable new venture.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
