**STRANGER**

Category: People

Unknown aspects of self, opportunities.
Strangers are parts of yourself
unrecognized. Friendly = new
opportunities. Threatening = rejected
aspects.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
