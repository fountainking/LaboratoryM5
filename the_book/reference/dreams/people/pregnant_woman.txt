**PREGNANT WOMAN**

Category: People

Creativity, potential, growth.
Pregnancy symbolizes something
developing. You pregnant = new ideas
gestating. Someone else = witnessing
creation.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
