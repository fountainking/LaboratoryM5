**SPIDER**

Category: Animals

Creativity, patience, feminine energy.
Spiders weave fate and destiny. Web =
feeling trapped or creating reality.
Bite = creative block or toxic
relationship.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
