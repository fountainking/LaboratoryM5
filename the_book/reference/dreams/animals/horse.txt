Power, freedom, drive. Horses symbolize
raw energy and passion. Riding =
control. Wild horse = untamed emotions.
White horse = spiritual awareness.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
