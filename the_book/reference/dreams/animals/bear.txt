**BEAR**

Category: Animals

Strength, introspection, protection.
Bears represent primal power and
motherhood. Hibernating = need for
rest. Attacking = repressed anger. Cubs
= nurturing needed.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
