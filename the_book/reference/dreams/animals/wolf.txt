**WOLF**

Category: Animals

Instinct, intelligence, appetite for
freedom. Wolves represent shadow self.
Pack = family/community. Lone wolf =
independence. Howling = calling for
help.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
