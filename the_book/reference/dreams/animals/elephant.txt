**ELEPHANT**

Category: Animals

Memory, wisdom, strength. Elephants
never forget. Trunk up = good luck.
Herd = family bonds. Baby elephant =
new beginning with wisdom.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
