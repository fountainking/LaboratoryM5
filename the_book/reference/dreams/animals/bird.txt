**BIRD**

Category: Animals

Freedom, spirituality, aspirations.
Birds represent transcendence and
liberation. Flying = success. Caged =
restriction. Dead bird = lost hopes.
Singing = joy coming.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
