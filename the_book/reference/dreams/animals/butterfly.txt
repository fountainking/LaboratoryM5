**BUTTERFLY**

Transformation, rebirth, beauty.
Butterflies signify metamorphosis and
change. Cocoon = transformation in
progress. Landing on you = blessing.
Multiple = social connections.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
