DOG

Category: Animals

Loyalty, friendship, protection. Dogs
represent faithful companions and
unconditional love. May indicate trust
issues or need for companionship.
Aggressive dog = inner conflict.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
