CAT

Category: Animals

Independence, intuition, feminine
power. Cats symbolize mystery and
spiritual awareness. May suggest need
for independence or warning about
deceit. Multiple cats = creativity.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
