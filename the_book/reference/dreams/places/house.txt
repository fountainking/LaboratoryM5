**HOUSE**

Category: Places

Self, psyche, comfort zone. Rooms =
aspects of self. Basement =
unconscious. Attic = higher
consciousness. Kitchen = nourishment.
Bedroom = intimacy. Bathroom =
cleansing.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
