**ROAD**

Category: Places

Life path, journey, direction. Roads =
life direction. Straight = clear path.
Winding = uncertainty. Dead end =
feeling stuck. Fork = decision point.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
