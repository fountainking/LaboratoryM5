**HOSPITAL**

Category: Places

Healing, vulnerability, transformation.
Hospitals = need for healing. Patient =
receiving care. Doctor = helping others
heal. Surgery = deep transformation.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
