**FLYING**

Category: Places

Freedom, perspective, transcendence.
Flying = liberation from limitations.
High flying = success. Difficulty
flying = obstacles. Falling while
flying = loss of control.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
