**MOUNTAIN**

Category: Places

Challenges, goals, achievement.
Mountains = obstacles to overcome.
Climbing = striving toward goals.
Summit = success. Steep = difficult
challenge.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
