**FOREST**

Category: Places

Unconscious, mystery, growth. Forests
represent unknown territory. Dark
forest = confusion. Light forest =
exploration. Lost = searching for
direction.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
