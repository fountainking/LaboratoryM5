**CAVE**

Category: Places

Unconscious, shelter, hidden knowledge.
Caves are womb-like spaces. Dark cave =
exploring unconscious. Treasure in cave
= hidden talents.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
