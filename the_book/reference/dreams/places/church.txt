**CHURCH**

Category: Places

Spirituality, morality, seeking
guidance. Churches = spiritual needs.
Empty church = feeling disconnected.
Full church = community support.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
