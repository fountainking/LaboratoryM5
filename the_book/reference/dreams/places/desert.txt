**DESERT**

Category: Places

Emptiness, spiritual quest, isolation.
Deserts symbolize barren periods. May
indicate feeling emotionally dry. Oasis
= finding sustenance.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
