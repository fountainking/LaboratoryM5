**BRIDGE**

Category: Places

Transition, connection, passage.
Bridges connect two states. Crossing =
major transition. Collapsing bridge =
transition anxiety. Under bridge =
avoiding change.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
