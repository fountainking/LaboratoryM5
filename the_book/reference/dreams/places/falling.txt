**FALLING**

Category: Places

Loss of control, anxiety, insecurity.
Falling = feeling overwhelmed. May
reflect work stress or relationship
instability. Landing safely =
resilience.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
