**RESTAURANT**

Category: Places

Nourishment, social connection,
choices. Restaurants = how you feed
yourself emotionally. Menu = life
choices. Alone = self-sufficiency.
Group = community.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
