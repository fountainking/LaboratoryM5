**GARDEN**

Category: Places

Growth, cultivation, potential. Gardens
= what you're growing. Blooming =
success. Weeds = neglect. Planting =
new projects. Harvesting = reaping
rewards.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
