**SCHOOL**

Category: Places

Lessons, testing, social anxiety.
School represents life lessons. Lost in
school = feeling unprepared. Naked at
school = vulnerability. Passing test =
overcoming challenge.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
