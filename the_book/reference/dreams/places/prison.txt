**PRISON**

Category: Places

Restriction, guilt, punishment. Prisons
= feeling trapped. Prisoner =
self-imposed limits. Escaping =
breaking free. Guard = harsh inner
critic.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
