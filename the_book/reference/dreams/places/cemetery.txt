**CEMETERY**

Category: Places

Endings, grief, letting go. Cemeteries
= what has died. Visiting grave =
processing loss. Peaceful cemetery =
acceptance.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
