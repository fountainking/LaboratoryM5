**MIRROR**

Category: Objects

Self-reflection, truth, perception. How
you appear = self-perception. Broken
mirror = fractured self-image. Can't
see reflection = identity crisis.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
