**CHAIR**

Category: Objects

Position, rest, status. Chair = where
you sit in life. Throne = power. Empty
chair = absence. Broken chair =
unstable position.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
