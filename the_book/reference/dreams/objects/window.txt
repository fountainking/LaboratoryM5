**WINDOW**

Category: Objects

Perspective, clarity, opportunities.
Looking through = observing life.
Broken window = shattered illusions.
Closed window = closed off.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
