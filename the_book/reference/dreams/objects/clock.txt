**CLOCK**

Category: Objects

Time pressure, deadlines, mortality.
Clocks = time concerns. Broken clock =
timelessness. Running out of time =
deadline pressure. Stopped clock =
suspended moment.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
