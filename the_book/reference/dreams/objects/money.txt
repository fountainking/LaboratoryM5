**MONEY**

Category: Objects

Self-worth, power, resources. Finding
money = discovering talents. Losing
money = feeling undervalued. Stealing =
taking what's not yours. Giving =
generosity.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
