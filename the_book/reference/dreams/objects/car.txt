CAR

Category: Objects

Life direction, control, personal
drive. Driver's seat = control of life.
Passenger = not in control. Accident =
feeling out of control. Broken car =
stalled progress.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
