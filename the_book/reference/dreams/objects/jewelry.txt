**JEWELRY**

Category: Objects

Value, self-worth, gifts. Jewelry =
what you treasure. Losing = forgetting
worth. Receiving = recognizing value.
Fake = false values.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
