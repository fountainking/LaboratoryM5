**DOOR**

Category: Objects

Opportunities, transitions, choices.
Open door = opportunity. Closed door =
blocked path. Locked door = obstacles.
Many doors = overwhelming choices.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
