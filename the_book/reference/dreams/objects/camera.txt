**CAMERA**

Category: Objects

Perspective, memory, observation.
Camera = capturing moments. Taking
photo = wanting to remember. Looking at
photos = reviewing past.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
