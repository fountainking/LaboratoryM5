**COMPUTER**

Category: Objects

Mind, processing, connections. Computer
= mental processes. Crash = mental
overwhelm. Hacked = boundaries
violated. Working well = clear
thinking.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
