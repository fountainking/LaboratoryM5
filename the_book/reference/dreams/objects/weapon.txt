**WEAPON**

Category: Objects

Defense, aggression, power. Weapons =
how you protect yourself. Gun = direct
aggression. Knife = cutting away.
Broken weapon = powerlessness.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
