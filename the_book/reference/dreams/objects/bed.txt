BED

Category: Objects

Rest, intimacy, vulnerability. Bed =
personal space. Comfortable =
self-care. Unmade = chaos. Someone in
bed = intimacy or invasion.

Remember: Dream symbols are deeply
personal. Your own associations and
feelings about symbols matter most. Use
this as a starting point, not absolute
truth.
