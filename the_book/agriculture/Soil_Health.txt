**SOIL HEALTH & MANAGEMENT**

**COMPREHENSIVE SOIL GUIDE**

**OVERVIEW:**
Healthy soil is the foundation of
productive gardens. Understanding and
improving soil is critical for food
security.

**SOIL COMPONENTS:**

**MINERAL PARTICLES:**
Sand:
- Large particles
- Drains quickly
- Warms fast
- Low nutrients

Silt:
- Medium particles
- Moderate drainage
- Fertile
- Good for most crops

Clay:
- Small particles
- Drains slowly
- Holds nutrients
- Hard when dry

**IDEAL MIX (LOAM):**
- 40% sand
- 40% silt
- 20% clay
- Best for most vegetables

**ORGANIC MATTER:**
Living and dead organisms:
- Decomposing plants
- Beneficial microbes
- Fungi
- Earthworms
- Insects

Benefits:
- Improves structure
- Holds water
- Provides nutrients
- Feeds microbes
- Prevents compaction

**SOIL LIFE:**
Billions per gram:
- Bacteria
- Fungi
- Protozoa
- Nematodes
- Arthropods

**TESTING SOIL:**

JAR TEST (Texture):
1. Fill jar 1/3 with soil
2. Add water to fill
3. Add drop of dish soap
4. Shake vigorously
5. Let settle 24-48 hours
6. Layers show sand/silt/clay

**SQUEEZE TEST:**
Sandy: Falls apart
Loamy: Forms ball, breaks easily
Clay: Forms ribbon, sticky

pH TESTING:
Use pH kit or meter:
- Most vegetables: 6.0-7.0
- Acidic: <6.0
- Alkaline: >7.0

HOME pH TEST:
Vinegar test (alkaline):
- Add vinegar to soil
- Fizzes = alkaline

Baking soda test (acidic):
- Mix soil with water
- Add baking soda
- Fizzes = acidic

**NUTRIENT TESTING:**
Professional test shows:
- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Micronutrients
- pH

Get test through:
- Extension service
- Garden centers
- Online labs

**IMPROVING SOIL:**

**ADDING ORGANIC MATTER:**
Best amendments:
- Compost (all-purpose)
- Aged manure (rich)
- Leaf mold (structure)
- Peat moss (acidifying)
- Coconut coir (sustainable)

**AMOUNT:**
Add 2-4 inches annually
Work into top 6-8 inches

**COMPOST MAKING:**

**HOT COMPOSTING:**
Fastest method (2-3 months):
1. Pile must be 3×3×3 feet minimum
2. Layer greens and browns
3. Keep moist
4. Turn weekly
5. Heat to 130-150°F
6. Ready when dark and crumbly

**COLD COMPOSTING:**
Slow method (6-12 months):
1. Pile materials
2. Add as available
3. No turning needed
4. Takes longer
5. Less effort

**INGREDIENTS:**
Greens (nitrogen):
- Kitchen scraps
- Grass clippings
- Green leaves
- Coffee grounds
- Fresh manure

Browns (carbon):
- Dry leaves
- Straw
- Sawdust
- Paper
- Cardboard

**RATIO:**
3 parts brown : 1 part green

**MOISTURE:**
Like wrung-out sponge
Too wet = smelly
Too dry = slow decomposition

ADJUSTING pH:

RAISING pH (less acidic):
Add:
- Lime (calcium carbonate)
- Wood ash
- Bone meal
- Crushed eggshells

Application:
- Apply in fall
- Work into soil
- Retest spring

LOWERING pH (more acidic):
Add:
- Sulfur
- Peat moss
- Pine needles
- Coffee grounds

Application:
- Takes months to work
- Apply in fall
- Retest regularly

**IMPROVING DRAINAGE:**

**POOR DRAINAGE FIXES:**
- Add compost
- Add sand (lots!)
- Create raised beds
- Install drainage tiles
- Improve grade

**SIGNS OF POOR DRAINAGE:**
- Standing water
- Mud
- Slow plant growth
- Yellow plants
- Root rot

**IMPROVING SANDY SOIL:**

**PROBLEMS:**
- Dries quickly
- Low nutrients
- Poor water retention

**SOLUTIONS:**
- Add compost heavily
- Add peat moss
- Mulch heavily
- Water frequently
- Fertilize more often

**IMPROVING CLAY SOIL:**

**PROBLEMS:**
- Poor drainage
- Hard when dry
- Compacts easily
- Slow to warm

**SOLUTIONS:**
- Add compost
- Add sand (LOTS!)
- Gypsum helps
- Don't work when wet
- Raised beds

**DON'T:**
Add only sand (makes concrete!)
Need both sand AND organic matter

**COVER CROPS:**

**PURPOSE:**
- Add nitrogen
- Prevent erosion
- Improve structure
- Suppress weeds
- Add organic matter

**TYPES:**
Nitrogen fixers:
- Clover
- Vetch
- Peas
- Beans

Biomass producers:
- Rye
- Oats
- Buckwheat
- Annual ryegrass

**WHEN TO PLANT:**
Fall:
- After harvest
- Grows over winter
- Till in spring

Spring:
- Between crops
- Quick growers
- Till before flowering

**MULCHING:**

**BENEFITS:**
- Conserves water
- Suppresses weeds
- Moderates temperature
- Adds organic matter (organic mulches)
- Prevents erosion

**ORGANIC MULCHES:**
- Straw (best for vegetables)
- Wood chips (paths, perennials)
- Leaves (free!)
- Grass clippings (thin layers)
- Compost (enriching)

**INORGANIC MULCHES:**
- Black plastic (warming)
- Landscape fabric (long-term)
- Gravel (permanent)

**APPLICATION:**
- 2-4 inches deep
- Keep away from plant stems
- Replenish as needed
- Don't mulch cool-season crops in cold
weather

**NO-TILL GARDENING:**

**BENEFITS:**
- Preserves soil structure
- Protects microbes
- Saves work
- Improves water retention

**METHOD:**
1. Never dig or till
2. Add compost on top
3. Heavy mulching
4. Let worms incorporate
5. Plant through mulch

**SHEET MULCHING:**
1. Mow existing vegetation
2. Layer cardboard/newspaper
3. Add 4-6 inches compost
4. Top with straw mulch
5. Plant next season

**EROSION CONTROL:**

**CAUSES:**
- Water runoff
- Wind
- Bare soil
- Steep slopes

**PREVENTION:**
- Plant cover crops
- Mulch heavily
- Contour planting
- Terracing slopes
- Windbreaks

**WATER MANAGEMENT:**

**IRRIGATION:**
Efficient methods:
- Drip (most efficient)
- Soaker hoses
- Ollas (buried pots)
- Mulch (reduces need)

**RAINWATER HARVESTING:**
- Rain barrels
- Swales
- Ponds
- Berms

**SOIL BUILDING TIMELINE:**

**YEAR 1:**
- Test soil
- Add amendments
- Plant cover crop
- Start composting

**YEAR 2:**
- Heavy compost addition
- Mulch all beds
- Retest pH
- Observe improvement

**YEAR 3:**
- Maintenance mode
- Annual compost
- Continue mulching
- Excellent soil achieved

**ONGOING:**
- Add compost annually
- Rotate crops
- Maintain organic matter
- Monitor pH

**EMERGENCY SOIL IMPROVEMENT:**

**NO COMPOST AVAILABLE:**
Use:
- Aged manure
- Leaf mold
- Grass clippings
- Any organic matter

**NO AMENDMENTS AT ALL:**
- Deep mulching
- Plant legumes (fix nitrogen)
- Let plants decompose in place
- Save all organic waste

**POOR INITIAL SOIL:**
- Raised beds with brought-in soil
- Container gardening
- Focus on soil building first year
- Plant soil-improving crops

**LONG-TERM FERTILITY:**

**SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES:**
- Return all plant waste
- Minimal tilling
- Crop rotation
- Cover cropping
- Composting
- Mulching

**AVOID:**
- Synthetic fertilizers (temporary)
- Over-tilling (damages structure)
- Removing all plant material
- Mono-cropping
- Bare soil
