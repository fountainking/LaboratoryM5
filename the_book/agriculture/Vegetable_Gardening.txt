**VEGETABLE GARDENING GUIDE**

**COMPLETE FOOD PRODUCTION REFERENCE**

**OVERVIEW:**
Growing your own food provides
nutrition, self-sufficiency, and
survival security. Even small spaces
can produce significant yields.

**SITE SELECTION:**

**SUNLIGHT:**
Most vegetables need:
- Full sun (6-8 hours minimum)
- South-facing (Northern Hemisphere)
- Away from shade trees
- Open, not enclosed

**WATER ACCESS:**
- Near water source
- Can irrigate easily
- Good drainage (not swampy)
- Slight slope ideal

**SOIL QUALITY:**
Test for:
- pH 6.0-7.0 (most vegetables)
- Good drainage
- Dark, rich color
- Earthworm presence
- Crumbly texture

**SOIL PREPARATION:**

**CLEARING:**
1. Remove grass/weeds
2. Till or dig deeply
3. Remove rocks/debris
4. Break up clods
5. Level surface

**AMENDING:**
Add organic matter:
- Compost (best)
- Aged manure
- Peat moss
- Leaf mold
- Cover crop residue

**RATIO:**
Mix 2-4 inches of organic matter into
top 6-8 inches of soil

**RAISED BEDS:**
Advantages:
- Better drainage
- Warmer soil
- Less bending
- Control soil quality
- Fewer weeds

Construction:
- 4 feet wide (reach center)
- Any length
- 6-12 inches tall
- Wood/stone/metal sides

**SEED STARTING:**

**DIRECT SEEDING:**
Plant directly in garden:
- Beans
- Corn
- Carrots
- Radishes
- Peas
- Squash
- Cucumbers

**INDOOR STARTING:**
Start indoors, transplant:
- Tomatoes
- Peppers
- Eggplant
- Cabbage
- Broccoli
- Lettuce

**SEED DEPTH:**
General rule:
Plant 2-3× seed diameter deep

**SPACING:**
Follow seed packet instructions
Don't overcrowd!

**ESSENTIAL VEGETABLES:**

**TOMATOES:**
- High yield
- Long season
- Stake or cage

- Water consistently

Growing tips:
- Plant deep (bury stem)
- Pinch suckers
- Mulch heavily
- Full sun required

**LETTUCE:**

- Warm season
- Direct seed

Growing tips:
- Plant after frost
- Don't overwater
- Pick frequently
- Support pole types

**CARROTS:**

- Fall harvest best

Growing tips:
- Thin seedlings
- Keep moist
- Mulch for storage
- No fresh manure

**SQUASH:**
- High yielding
- Space intensive
- Warm season
- Summer/winter types
- Good storage (winter)

Growing tips:
- Hills or mounds
- Pollination critical
- Watch for borers
- Cure winter types

**PEPPERS:**
- Warm season
- Long season
- Productive
- Various heat levels
- Good fresh or dried

Growing tips:
- Start early indoors
- Transplant after frost
- Stake for support
- Consistent watering

**WATERING:**

**AMOUNT:**
Most vegetables need:
- 1-2 inches per week
- Deep watering better than frequent
light
- Morning watering best
- Evening OK, avoid midday

**METHODS:**
Drip irrigation:
- Most efficient
- Reduces disease
- Conserves water
- Can automate

Soaker hoses:
- Easy setup
- Even distribution
- Leave in place
- Cover with mulch

Hand watering:
- Control amount
- Time intensive
- Good for small gardens
- Water base, not leaves

**SIGNS OF WATER STRESS:**
Too little:
- Wilting
- Slow growth
- Fruit drop
- Leaf curl

Too much:
- Yellow leaves
- Fungal disease
- Slow growth
- Root rot

**FERTILIZING:**

**ORGANIC OPTIONS:**
- Compost (all-purpose)
- Manure (aged only!)
- Fish emulsion (nitrogen)
- Bone meal (phosphorus)
- Wood ash (potassium)

**TIMING:**
- Before planting (soil prep)
- Side-dress growing plants
- Foliar spray for quick boost
- Every 3-4 weeks during growth

**NPK RATIO:**
- N (Nitrogen): Leafy growth
- P (Phosphorus): Roots, flowers
- K (Potassium): Overall health

Vegetables need balanced fertilizer
Example: 10-10-10 or 5-10-10

**PEST CONTROL:**

**PREVENTION:**
Best defense:
- Healthy plants
- Crop rotation
- Companion planting
- Row covers
- Handpicking

**ORGANIC METHODS:**
- Neem oil (insects)
- Diatomaceous earth (crawling)
- Bt spray (caterpillars)
- Insecticidal soap
- Garlic spray

**COMPANION PLANTING:**
Helpful combinations:
- Tomatoes + basil (flavor, pests)
- Corn + beans + squash (3 sisters)
- Carrots + onions (pest control)
- Marigolds + anything (nematodes)

**COMMON PESTS:**
Aphids:
- Spray with water
- Ladybugs eat them
- Neem oil

Tomato hornworms:
- Handpick
- Bt spray
- Let wasps parasitize

Cabbage worms:
- Row covers
- Handpick
- Bt spray

Slugs/snails:
- Beer traps
- Copper barriers
- Handpick at night
- Diatomaceous earth

**HARVESTING:**

**TIMING:**
Each vegetable has signs:
- Tomatoes: Full color, slight give
- Peppers: Full size, firm
- Beans: Before seeds bulge
- Lettuce: Outer leaves anytime
- Squash: When tender (summer)

**TECHNIQUE:**
- Use clean, sharp tools
- Cut, don't pull
- Harvest regularly
- Morning is best (crisp)

**STORAGE:**
Immediate:
- Wash if dirty
- Cool quickly
- Don't wash if storing
- Remove damaged parts

**EXTENDING SEASON:**

**EARLY START:**
- Row covers
- Cold frames
- Wall o' water
- Black plastic mulch (warms soil)

**LATE HARVEST:**
- Row covers
- Low tunnels
- Mulch heavily
- Choose cold-hardy crops

**SUCCESSION PLANTING:**
Plant every 2 weeks:
- Lettuce
- Radishes
- Beans
- Carrots

Ensures continuous harvest

**SEED SAVING:**

**EASY CROPS:**
- Tomatoes
- Beans
- Peas
- Lettuce (if not hybrid)
- Peppers

**METHOD:**
1. Choose best plants
2. Let fruit fully mature
3. Extract seeds
4. Clean and dry
5. Store cool and dry
6. Label with date/variety

**AVOID HYBRIDS:**
Seeds won't grow true
Look for "heirloom" or
"open-pollinated"

**COMPOSTING:**

**BENEFITS:**
- Free fertilizer
- Improves soil
- Reduces waste
- Feeds microbes

**WHAT TO COMPOST:**
Green (nitrogen):
- Kitchen scraps
- Fresh grass
- Green leaves
- Coffee grounds

Brown (carbon):
- Dry leaves
- Straw
- Paper
- Cardboard

**WHAT NOT TO COMPOST:**
- Meat/dairy
- Pet waste
- Diseased plants
- Weeds with seeds

**PROCESS:**
1. Layer greens and browns
2. Keep moist (like sponge)
3. Turn weekly
4. Ready in 2-6 months

**CROP ROTATION:**

**WHY:**
- Prevents disease
- Balances nutrients
- Reduces pests
- Improves soil

**4-YEAR ROTATION:**
Year 1: Tomatoes/peppers/eggplant
Year 2: Beans/peas
Year 3: Cabbage family
Year 4: Root vegetables

**WINTER PLANNING:**

**GARDEN JOURNAL:**
Record:
- What was planted where
- Dates (planting, harvest)
- Yields
- Problems
- Weather notes
- Next year plans

**SEED ORDERS:**
- Order early (best selection)
- Choose varieties suited to climate
- Try one new crop per year
- Stock up on favorites

**TOOL MAINTENANCE:**
- Clean and sharpen
- Oil moving parts
- Repair/replace broken
- Store properly

**EMERGENCY FOOD GARDENS:**

**PRIORITY CROPS:**
High calorie, storable:
- Potatoes (high yield, stores)
- Dried beans (protein, stores)
- Winter squash (calories, stores)
- Corn (calories, dried)
- Root vegetables (stores)

**MAXIMIZE SPACE:**
- Vertical growing
- Intensive spacing
- Succession planting
- Interplanting
- Container gardening

**MINIMAL INPUT:**
- Drought tolerant crops
- Disease resistant varieties
- Perennials (asparagus, rhubarb)
- Self-seeding (lettuce)
