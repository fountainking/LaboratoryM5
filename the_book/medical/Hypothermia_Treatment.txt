**HYPOTHERMIA - RECOGNITION &
TREATMENT**

**DEADLY COLD WEATHER THREAT**

**WHAT IT IS:**
- Body temperature drops below 95°F
- Normal is 98.6°F
- Can be fatal
- Even in mild weather (40-50°F)

**RISK FACTORS:**
- Wet clothing
- Wind (wind chill)
- Exhaustion
- Lack of food
- Inadequate clothing
- Elderly or young
- Alcohol consumption

**STAGES:**

**MILD (95-97°F):**
- Shivering (intense)
- Cold hands/feet
- Numbness
- Clumsiness
- Difficulty with tasks
- Increased breathing/heart rate

**MODERATE (90-95°F):**
- Violent shivering or stops
- Confusion
- Drowsiness
- Slurred speech
- Stumbling
- Irrational behavior
- Poor judgment

SEVERE (Below 90°F):
- No shivering
- Blue skin
- Dilated pupils
- Very slow breathing
- Weak pulse
- Unconsciousness
- Appears dead
- Can still be saved!

**TREATMENT:**

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
1. Get to shelter
2. Remove wet clothing
3. Insulate from ground
4. Add dry layers
5. Cover head (major heat loss)
6. Warm gradually

**MILD HYPOTHERMIA:**
- Active rewarming okay
- Warm drinks (not alcohol!)
- Light exercise if able
- Huddle with others
- Warm, sweet drinks
- High-calorie food

**MODERATE HYPOTHERMIA:**
- Passive rewarming
- Insulation only
- Warm drinks if conscious
- No vigorous activity
- Handle gently
- Monitor closely

**SEVERE HYPOTHERMIA:**
**⚠️ CRITICAL:**
- Handle extremely gently
- Horizontal position
- Core warming only
- Warm drinks if conscious/able
- Don't rub extremities
- Medical emergency
- May seem dead but savable

**WARMING METHODS:**

**BODY HEAT:**
- Skin-to-skin contact
- In sleeping bag together
- Focus on core (chest/neck)
- Very effective
- Two warm people better

**WARM LIQUIDS:**
- Hot tea/coffee (not alcohol!)
- Hot cocoa
- Warm soup/broth
- High sugar content helps
- Sip slowly
- Only if conscious

**FIRE/HEAT:**
- Gradual warming
- Don't get too close
- Risk of burns (numbness)
- Warm core first
- Rotate to warm evenly

**INSULATION:**
- Sleeping bag
- Blankets
- Emergency blanket
- Dry clothing
- Cover head
- Insulate from ground

**WHAT NOT TO DO:**

**NEVER:**
- Give alcohol (worsens)
- Warm too quickly
- Apply heat to extremities first
- Rub or massage
- Give unconscious person liquids
- Assume they're dead

**WHY NOT EXTREMITIES FIRST:**
- Cold blood rushes to core
- Can cause heart attack
- "After-drop" phenomenon
- Core first, always

**PREVENTION:**

**CLOTHING:**
- Layer system
- Base: moisture-wicking
- Mid: insulation
- Outer: windproof/waterproof
- Cotton kills (stays wet)
- Wool or synthetic

**STAY DRY:**
- Waterproof outer layer
- Change wet clothes immediately
- Avoid sweating
- Ventilate when active
- Dry clothes by fire

**HEAD COVERAGE:**
- Lose 40% heat through head
- Hat essential
- Balaclava in severe cold
- Keep ears covered

**FOOD & WATER:**
- Eat regularly
- High-calorie foods
- Fats and proteins
- Stay hydrated
- Body burns more calories in cold

**RECOGNITION:**
- "Umbles": Mumbles, Stumbles, Grumbles
- Confusion
- Poor coordination
- Stop and warm up

**SHELTERS:**

**EMERGENCY:**
- Snow cave (if snow deep)
- Debris hut
- Lean-to with reflector
- Get out of wind
- Insulate from ground

**SLEEPING:**
- Insulated pad essential
- Fill gaps in sleeping bag
- Multiple people share warmth
- Fire if safe
- Ventilation important

**CHILDREN:**
- Cool faster
- More vulnerable
- May not complain
- Check frequently
- Extra layers

**ELDERLY:**
- Less able to shiver
- Medications may affect
- Monitor closely
- More layers needed

**RECOVERY:**
- Continue warming
- Monitor for hours
- Give food
- Keep dry
- Rest
- Gradual return to activity

**COLD WATER:**
**⚠️ VERY DANGEROUS:**
- Hypothermia in minutes
- Even 50°F water deadly
- Get out immediately
- Remove wet clothes
- Dry and warm quickly

**SURVIVAL TIP:**
If someone appears dead from cold,
continue warming - may revive!
"Not dead until warm and dead"

**WINTER SURVIVAL PRIORITIES:**
1. Shelter from wind
2. Insulation
3. Dry clothing
4. Caloric intake
5. Stay hydrated
