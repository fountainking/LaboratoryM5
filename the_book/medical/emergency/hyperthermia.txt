Hyperthermia

Hyperthermia, also known as
overheating, is a condition in which an
individual's body temperature is
elevated beyond normal due to failed
thermoregulation. The person's body
produces or absorbs more heat than it
dissipates. According to the
International Emergency Medicine
Education Project, severe hyperthermia
"becomes a medical emergency requiring
immediate treatment to prevent
disability or death". Almost half a
million deaths are recorded every year
from hyperthermia.
