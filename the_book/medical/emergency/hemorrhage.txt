Bleeding

Bleeding, hemorrhage, haemorrhage or
blood loss, is blood escaping from the
circulatory system from damaged blood
vessels. Bleeding can occur internally,
or externally either through a natural
opening such as the mouth, nose, ear,
urethra, vagina, or anus, or through a
puncture in the skin.
Hypovolemia is a massive decrease in
blood volume, and death by excessive
loss of blood is referred to as
exsanguination. Typically, a healthy
person can endure a loss of 10–15% of
the total blood volume without serious
medical difficulties. The stopping or
controlling of bleeding is called
hemostasis and is an important part of
both first aid and surgery.
