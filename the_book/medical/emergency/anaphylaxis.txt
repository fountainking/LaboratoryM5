Anaphylaxis

Anaphylaxis is a serious, potentially
fatal allergic reaction and medical
emergency that is rapid in onset and
requires immediate medical attention
regardless of the availability of
on-site treatments while not under
medical care. It typically causes more
than one of the following: an itchy
rash, throat closing due to swelling
that can obstruct or stop breathing;
severe tongue swelling that can also
interfere with or stop breathing;
shortness of breath, vomiting,
lightheadedness, loss of consciousness,
low blood pressure, and medical shock.
