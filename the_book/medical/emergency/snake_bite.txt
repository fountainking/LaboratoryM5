Snakebite

A snakebite is an injury caused by the
bite of a snake, especially a venomous
snake. A common sign of a bite from a
venomous snake is the presence of two
puncture wounds from the animal's
fangs. Sometimes venom injection from
the bite may occur. This may result in
redness, swelling, and severe pain at
the area, which may take up to an hour
to appear. Vomiting, blurred vision,
tingling of the limbs, and sweating may
result. Most bites are on the hands,
arms, or legs. Fear following a bite is
common with symptoms of a racing heart
and feeling faint. The venom may cause
bleeding, kidney failure, a severe
allergic reaction, tissue death around
the bite, or breathing problems. Bites
may result in the loss of a limb or
other chronic problems or even death.
