Bone fracture

A bone fracture is a medical condition
in which there is a partial or complete
break in the continuity of any bone in
the body. In more severe cases, the
bone may be broken into several
fragments, known as a comminuted
fracture. An open fracture is a bone
fracture where the broken bone breaks
through the skin.
