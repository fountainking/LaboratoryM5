First aid

First aid is the first and immediate
assistance given to any person with a
medical emergency, with care provided
to preserve life, prevent the condition
from worsening, or to promote recovery
until medical services arrive. First
aid is generally performed by someone
with basic medical or first response
training. Mental health first aid is an
extension of the concept of first aid
to cover mental health, while
psychological first aid is used as
early treatment of people who are at
risk for developing PTSD. Conflict
first aid, focused on preservation and
recovery of an individual's social or
relationship well-being, is being
piloted in Canada.
