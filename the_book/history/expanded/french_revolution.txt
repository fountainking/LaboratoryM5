French Revolution

The French Revolution was a period of
political and societal change in France
that began with the Estates General of
1789 and ended with the Coup of 18
Brumaire on 9 November 1799. Many of
the revolution's ideas are considered
fundamental principles of liberal
democracy, and its values remain
central to modern French political
discourse. It was caused by a
combination of social, political, and
economic factors which the existing
regime proved unable to manage.
