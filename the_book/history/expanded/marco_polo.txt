Marco Polo

Marco Polo was a Venetian merchant,
explorer and writer who travelled
through Asia along the Silk Road
between 1271 and 1295. His travels are
recorded in The Travels of Marco Polo,
a book that described the
then-mysterious culture and inner
workings of the Eastern world,
including the wealth and great size of
the Mongol Empire and China under the
Yuan dynasty, giving Europeans their
first comprehensive look into China,
Persia, India, Japan, and other Asian
societies.
