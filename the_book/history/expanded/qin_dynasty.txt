Qin dynasty

The Qin dynasty was the first imperial
dynasty of China. It is named for its
progenitor state of Qin, a fief of the
confederal Zhou dynasty. Beginning in
230 BC, the Qin under King Ying Zheng
engaged in a series of wars conquering
each of the rival states that had
previously pledged fealty to the Zhou.
This culminated in 221 BC with the
successful unification of China under
Qin, which then assumed an imperial
prerogative – with Ying Zheng declaring
himself to be Qin Shi Huang, the first
emperor of China, and bringing an end
to the Warring States period. This
state of affairs lasted until 206 BC,
when the dynasty collapsed in the years
following Qin Shi Huang's death. The
Qin dynasty's 14-year existence was the
shortest of any major dynasty in
Chinese history, with only two
emperors. However, the succeeding Han
dynasty largely continued the military
and administrative practices instituted
by the Qin; as a result, the Qin have
been credited as the originators of the
Chinese imperial system that would
endure in some form until the Xinhai
Revolution in 1911.
