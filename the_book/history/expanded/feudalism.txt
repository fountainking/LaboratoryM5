Feudalism

Feudalism, also known as the feudal
system, was a combination of legal,
economic, military, cultural, and
political customs that flourished in
medieval Europe from the 9th to 15th
centuries. Broadly defined, it was a
way of structuring society around
relationships derived from the holding
of land in exchange for service or
labour.
