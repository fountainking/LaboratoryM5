Holy Roman Empire

The Holy Roman Empire, also known as
the Holy Roman Empire of the German
Nation after 1512, was a polity in
Central and Western Europe, usually
headed by the Holy Roman Emperor. It
developed in the Early Middle Ages, and
lasted for a millennium until its
dissolution in 1806 during the
Napoleonic Wars. Initially, it
comprised three constituent
kingdoms—Germany, Italy, and, from
1032, Burgundy—held together by the
emperor's overlordship. By the 15th
century, imperial governance became
concentrated in the Kingdom of Germany,
as the empire's effective control over
Italy and Burgundy had largely
disappeared.
