Ancient Egypt

Ancient Egypt was a cradle of
civilization concentrated along the
lower reaches of the Nile River in
Northeast Africa. It emerged from
prehistoric Egypt around 3150 BC, when
Upper and Lower Egypt were amalgamated
by Menes, who is believed by the
majority of Egyptologists to have been
the same person as Narmer. The history
of ancient Egypt unfolded as a series
of stable kingdoms interspersed by the
"Intermediate Periods" of relative
instability. These stable kingdoms
existed in one of three periods: the
Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age;
the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze
Age; or the New Kingdom of the Late
Bronze Age.
