Byzantine Empire

The Byzantine Empire, also known as the
Eastern Roman Empire, was the
continuation of the Roman Empire
centred on Constantinople during late
antiquity and the Middle Ages. Having
survived the events that caused the
fall of the Western Roman Empire in the
5th century AD, it endured until the
fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman
Empire in 1453. The term 'Byzantine
Empire' was coined only after its
demise; its citizens used the term
'Roman Empire' and called themselves
'Romans'.
