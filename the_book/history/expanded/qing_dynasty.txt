Qing dynasty

The Qing dynasty, officially the Great
Qing, was a Manchu-led imperial dynasty
of China and an early modern empire in
East Asia. The last imperial dynasty in
Chinese history, the Qing dynasty was
preceded by the Ming dynasty and
succeeded by the Republic of China. At
its height of power, the empire
stretched from the Sea of Japan in the
east to the Pamir Mountains in the
west, and from the Mongolian Plateau in
the north to the South China Sea in the
south. Originally emerging from the
Later Jin dynasty founded in 1616 and
proclaimed in Shenyang in 1636, the
dynasty seized control of the Ming
capital Beijing and North China in
1644, traditionally considered the
start of the dynasty's rule. The
dynasty lasted until the Xinhai
Revolution of October 1911 led to the
abdication of the last emperor in
February 1912. The multi-ethnic Qing
dynasty assembled the territorial base
for modern China. The Qing controlled
the most territory of any dynasty in
Chinese history, and in 1790
represented the fourth-largest empire
in world history to that point. With
over 426 million citizens in 1907, it
was the most populous country at the
time.
