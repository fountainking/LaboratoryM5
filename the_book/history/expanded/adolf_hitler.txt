Adolf Hitler

Adolf Hitler was an Austrian-born
German politician who was the dictator
of Germany during the Nazi period from
1933 until his suicide in 1945. He rose
to power as the leader of the Nazi
Party, becoming the chancellor in 1933
and then taking the title of Führer und
Reichskanzler in 1934. His invasion of
Poland on 1 September 1939 marked the
outbreak of the Second World War.
Throughout his leadership in the
ensuing conflict, he was closely
involved in the direction of German
military operations and the
perpetration of the Holocaust—the
genocide of about six million Jews and
millions of other victims.
