Akkadian Empire

The Akkadian Empire or kingdom of
Akkad/Agade was an ancient kingdom,
often thought to be the first known
empire, succeeding the long-lived
city-states of Sumer. Centered on the
city of Akkad and its surrounding
region, the empire united the Semitic
Akkadian and Sumerian speakers under
one rule and exercised significant
influence across Mesopotamia, the
Levant, Iran and Anatolia, sending
military expeditions as far south as
Dilmun and Magan in the Arabian
Peninsula.
