Song dynasty

The Song dynasty was an imperial
dynasty of China that ruled from 960 to
1279. The dynasty was founded by
Emperor Taizu of Song, who usurped the
throne of the Later Zhou dynasty and
went on to conquer the rest of the Ten
Kingdoms, ending the Five Dynasties and
Ten Kingdoms period. The Song often
came into conflict with the
contemporaneous Liao, Western Xia and
Jin dynasties in northern China. After
retreating to southern China following
attacks by the Jin dynasty, the Song
was eventually conquered by the
Mongol-led Yuan dynasty.
