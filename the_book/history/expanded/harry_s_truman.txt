Harry S. Truman

Harry S. Truman was the 33rd president
of the United States, serving from 1945
to 1953. As the 34th vice president in
1945, he assumed the presidency upon
the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt that
year. Subsequently, Truman implemented
the Marshall Plan in the aftermath of
World War II to rebuild the economy of
Western Europe, and established both
the Truman Doctrine and NATO to contain
the expansion of Soviet communism. A
member of the Democratic Party, he
proposed numerous New Deal coalition
liberal domestic reforms, but few were
enacted by the conservative coalition
that dominated the United States
Congress.
