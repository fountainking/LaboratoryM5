Early Middle Ages

The Early Middle Ages, sometimes
controversially referred to as the Dark
Ages, is typically regarded by
historians as lasting from the late 5th
to the 10th century. They marked the
start of the Middle Ages of European
history, following the decline of the
Western Roman Empire, and preceding the
High Middle Ages. The alternative term
late antiquity, for the early part of
the period, emphasizes elements of
continuity with the Roman Empire, while
Early Middle Ages is used to emphasize
developments characteristic of the
earlier medieval period.
