Ptolemaic Kingdom

The Ptolemaic Kingdom or Ptolemaic
Empire was an ancient Greek polity
based in Egypt during the Hellenistic
period. It was founded in 305 BC by the
Macedonian Greek general Ptolemy I
Soter, a companion of Alexander the
Great, and ruled by the Ptolemaic
dynasty until the death of Cleopatra
VII in 30 BC. Reigning for nearly three
centuries, the Ptolemies were the
longest and final dynasty of ancient
Egypt, heralding a distinct era of
religious and cultural syncretism
between Greek and Egyptian culture.
