Hellenistic period

In classical antiquity, the Hellenistic
period covers the time in Greek and
Mediterranean history after Classical
Greece, between the death of Alexander
the Great in 323 BC and the death of
Cleopatra VII in 30 BC, which was
followed by the ascendancy of the Roman
Empire, as signified by the Battle of
Actium in 31 BC and the Roman conquest
of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year,
which eliminated the last major
Hellenistic kingdom. Its name stems
from the Ancient Greek word Hellas,
which was gradually recognized as the
name for Greece, from which the modern
historiographical term Hellenistic was
derived. The term "Hellenistic" is to
be distinguished from "Hellenic" in
that the latter refers to Greece
itself, while the former encompasses
all the ancient territories of the
period that had come under significant
Greek influence, particularly the
Hellenized Ancient Near East, after the
conquests of Alexander the Great.
