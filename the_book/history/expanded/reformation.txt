Reformation

The Reformation, also known as the
Protestant Reformation or the European
Reformation, was a time of major
theological movement in Western
Christianity in 16th-century Europe
that posed a religious and political
challenge to the papacy and the
authority of the Catholic Church
hierarchy. Towards the end of the
Renaissance, the Reformation marked the
beginning of Protestantism. It is
considered one of the events that
signified the end of the Middle Ages
and the beginning of the early modern
period in Europe.
