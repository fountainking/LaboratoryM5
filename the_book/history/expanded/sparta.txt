Sparta

Sparta was a prominent city-state in
Laconia in ancient Greece. In
antiquity, the state was known as
Lacedaemon, while "Sparta" referred to
its capital, a group of villages in the
valley of the Evrotas River in Laconia,
in southeastern Peloponnese. Around 650
BC, it rose to become one of the major
military powers in Greece, a status it
retained until 371 BC.
