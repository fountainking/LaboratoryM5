Phoenicia

Phoenicians were an ancient Semitic
people who inhabited city-states in
Canaan along the Levantine coast of the
eastern Mediterranean, primarily in
present-day Lebanon and parts of
coastal Syria. Their maritime
civilization expanded and contracted
over time, with its cultural core
stretching from Arwad to Mount Carmel.
Through trade and colonization, the
Phoenicians extended their influence
across the Mediterranean, from Cyprus
to the Iberian Peninsula, leaving
behind thousands of inscriptions.
