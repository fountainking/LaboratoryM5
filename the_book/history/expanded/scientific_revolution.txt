Scientific Revolution

The Scientific Revolution was a series
of events that marked the emergence of
modern science during the early modern
period, when developments in
mathematics, physics, astronomy,
biology and chemistry transformed the
views of society about nature. The
Scientific Revolution took place in
Europe in the second half of the
Renaissance period, with the 1543
Nicolaus Copernicus publication De
revolutionibus orbium coelestium often
cited as its beginning. The Scientific
Revolution has been called "the most
important transformation in human
history" since the Neolithic
Revolution.
