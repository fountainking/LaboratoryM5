**ELECTRONICS FUNDAMENTALS**

**COMPREHENSIVE ELECTRONICS GUIDE**

**OVERVIEW:**
Understanding electronics is crucial
for repairs, building devices, and
survival situations with modern
equipment.

**BASIC CONCEPTS:**

**ELECTRICITY:**
Flow of electrons through conductor

Key terms:
- Voltage (V): Electrical pressure
- Current (A): Flow rate
- Resistance (Ω): Opposition to flow
- Power (W): Work done

**OHM'S LAW:**
**V = I × R**

Where:
V = Voltage (volts)
I = Current (amps)
R = Resistance (ohms)

Examples:
- 12V battery with 6Ω resistor
**- I = V/R = 12/6 = 2A**
- Power = V × I = 12 × 2 = 24W

**COMPONENTS:**

**RESISTORS:**
Purpose: Limit current, divide voltage

Color code:
Black=0, Brown=1, Red=2, Orange=3
Yellow=4, Green=5, Blue=6
Violet=7, Gray=8, White=9

Reading:
- First two bands = value
- Third band = multiplier
- Fourth band = tolerance

**CAPACITORS:**
Purpose: Store electrical charge

Types:
- Ceramic (small values)
- Electrolytic (large values,
polarized)
- Tantalum (stable, polarized)

Uses:
- Filtering power supply
- Timing circuits
- Coupling signals
- Bypassing noise

**DIODES:**
Purpose: Allow current one direction
only

Types:
- Standard diode
- LED (light emitting)
- Zener (voltage reference)
- Schottky (low drop)

Marking:
- Band indicates cathode
- Current flows toward band

**TRANSISTORS:**
Purpose: Amplify or switch current

Types:
- NPN (most common)
- PNP (opposite polarity)
- MOSFET (high power)

Basic operation:
- Small base current controls large
collector current
- Ratio = gain (hFE)

**INTEGRATED CIRCUITS:**
Complex circuits in package

Types:
- Logic (digital)
- Operational amplifiers (analog)
- Microcontrollers (programmable)
- Voltage regulators

Handling:
- Static sensitive!
- Ground yourself

- Correct voltage

**POWER SUPPLIES:**

**BATTERIES:**
Types:
- Alkaline (1.5V, disposable)
- NiMH (1.2V, rechargeable)
- Lithium (3.7V, rechargeable)
- Lead acid (12V, car battery)

Series connection:
- Voltages add
- Same current
**- 4× 1.5V = 6V**

Parallel connection:
- Same voltage
- Currents add
- 2× 1000mAh = 2000mAh

**VOLTAGE REGULATION:**
Purpose: Stable voltage from variable
source

Linear regulators:
- 7805 = 5V output
- 7812 = 12V output
- Simple but wasteful

Switching regulators:
- More efficient
- More complex
- Handles higher power

**TESTING & TROUBLESHOOTING:**

Voltage measurement:
1. Set to voltage range
2. Parallel to component
3. Read display

Current measurement:
1. Set to current range
2. Break circuit
3. Insert meter in series
4. Read display

Resistance:
1. Power OFF circuit
2. Set to resistance
3. Touch probes to component
4. Read value

**COMMON PROBLEMS:**

**NO POWER:**
Check:

- Wire cutters
- Helping hands
- Desoldering tools

**TECHNIQUE:**
1. Clean tip
2. Heat component AND pad
3. Apply solder to joint (not iron)
4. Remove solder first
5. Remove iron
6. Don't move until cool

**GOOD JOINT:**

Process:
1. Heat joint fully
2. Remove solder
3. Lift component
4. Clean holes

**CIRCUITS:**

**SERIES CIRCUIT:**
Components in line:
- Same current through all
- Voltages add
- One failure breaks all

**PARALLEL CIRCUIT:**
Components side-by-side:
- Same voltage across all
- Currents add
