RULE OF THREES - SURVIVAL PRIORITIES

YOU CAN SURVIVE:
- 3 minutes without air (suffocation/drowning)
- 3 hours without shelter (extreme weather)
- 3 days without water
- 3 weeks without food

WATER IS YOUR #1 PRIORITY after shelter in extreme weather.

DEHYDRATION STAGES:
1-5% Loss: Thirst, discomfort, fatigue
6-10% Loss: Headache, dizziness, inability to walk
11-12% Loss: Delirium, swollen tongue
>12% Loss: Death

DAILY WATER NEEDS:
- Minimum: 2 liters (survival)
- Active: 3-4 liters
- Hot climate: 6-8 liters
- Cold climate: 3-5 liters (yes, you still need water!)

NEVER wait until you're thirsty. Thirst means you're already dehydrated.

FINDING WATER - TERRAIN INDICATORS

WATER FLOWS DOWNHILL - Follow these signs:

VALLEYS & RAVINES:
- Water collects at lowest points
- Look for green vegetation
- Listen for running water (travels far in quiet wilderness)
- Check dried creek beds - dig at lowest point

ROCK FORMATIONS:
- Limestone/porous rock holds water
- Look for seeps and springs at base of cliffs
- Water collects in rock depressions after rain
- Moss on north side of rocks indicates moisture

VEGETATION INDICATORS (CRITICAL):
These plants mean water is within 10 feet underground:

WILLOWS: Water within 6-10 feet
COTTONWOODS: Water within 10-15 feet
CATTAILS: Standing water or very shallow water table
SYCAMORES: Year-round water source nearby
SALT CEDAR: Water within 10 feet (but often alkaline)
GREASEWO<br/>OD: Water within 15-20 feet
ARROW WEED: Shallow water table

FERNS & MOSS: Moist environment, possible seep nearby

DIG FOR WATER:
- Outside bend of dried creek bed (3-6 feet down)
- Base of green vegetation in dry areas
- Sandy/gravelly soil easier to dig than clay
- Dig until soil is moist, wait for water to seep

MORNING DEW COLLECTION:
- Tie absorbent cloth around ankles
- Walk through grass at dawn
- Wring out into container
- Can collect 1 liter/hour in good conditions

ANIMAL INDICATORS FOR WATER

BIRDS:
Water birds (ducks, geese) = water very close
- Flying low in morning/evening = heading to water
- Circling = water source below
- Grain eaters drink at dawn and dusk
- Travel in straight lines toward water

Finches & pigeons stay within 1-2 miles of water
Ravens range up to 50 miles (less reliable)

MAMMALS:
DEER TRAILS:
- Follow convergence of trails downhill
- Deer drink at dawn/dusk
- Trails lead directly to water

COYOTE/WOLF TRACKS:
- Follow tracks downhill in morning
- Predators patrol water sources

RABBITS & RODENTS:
- Don't need to drink if eating green plants
- Not reliable water indicators

INSECTS (VERY RELIABLE):
BEES:
- Fly within 3-4 miles of water
- Follow flight path in late afternoon
- They return to hive in straight lines

FLIES: Cluster within 100 yards of water
MOSQUITOES: Breed in stagnant water (nearby)
ANTS: Column marching up tree may be going to water pocket

ANIMAL TRACKS CONVERGING = WATER AHEAD
- Follow the most-used trail
- Usually within 1 mile
- Check for scat - fresh means recent water visit

REPTILES & AMPHIBIANS:
FROGS: Must stay near water
- Follow croaking at dusk/night
- Within 100 yards of water

SNAKES: Often near water sources
- Be cautious approaching water
- Check surroundings first

WATER PURIFICATION - LIFE OR DEATH

PRIORITY: Always purify if possible. Diarrhea can kill you faster than contaminated water.

CONTAMINATION TYPES:
1. BIOLOGICAL: Bacteria, viruses, parasites (most common)
2. CHEMICAL: Pesticides, heavy metals (rare in wilderness)
3. PARTICULATE: Dirt, debris (easiest to remove)

METHOD 1: BOILING (MOST RELIABLE)
- Rolling boil for 1 minute (sea level)
- 3 minutes above 6,500 feet elevation
- Kills ALL biological contaminants
- Does NOT remove chemicals or heavy metals
- Let cool, oxygenate by pouring between containers

METHOD 2: FILTRATION
IMPROVISED FILTER:
Layer from bottom to top in container with hole:
1. Small stones/gravel (2 inches)
2. Coarse sand (2 inches)
3. Fine sand (2 inches)
4. Charcoal from fire (2 inches) - CRITICAL for chemicals
5. Cloth or grass (top layer)

Pour water through slowly
Removes particles and some chemicals
DOES NOT remove viruses or all bacteria
STILL BOIL AFTER FILTERING if possible

METHOD 3: CHEMICAL PURIFICATION
IODINE TABLETS:
- 2 tablets per liter
- Wait 30 minutes
- Doubles in cold water
- Don't use if pregnant

BLEACH (Unscented only):
- 2 drops per liter of clear water
- 4 drops per liter of cloudy water
- Wait 30 minutes
- Should have slight chlorine smell
- If not, repeat dose and wait 15 more minutes

METHOD 4: UV SUNLIGHT (SODIS)
- Fill clear plastic bottle
- Shake to oxygenate
- Place in direct sunlight for 6 hours (2 days if cloudy)
- UV kills pathogens
- Works ONLY in clear bottles
- Water must be clear (filter first if cloudy)

METHOD 5: SURVIVAL STILL (Solar)
- Dig hole in sunny spot
- Place container in center
- Cover hole with clear plastic
- Place rock in center of plastic (over container)
- Seal edges with dirt
- Water evaporates, condenses on plastic, drips into container
- Produces 1-2 liters per day
- 100% pure distilled water

EMERGENCY - NO PURIFICATION AVAILABLE:
Choose water source in this order:
1. Spring water (cleanest)
2. Fast-moving stream (rocks = oxygen = cleaner)
3. Lake (deep water, away from shore)
4. Pond (stagnant - high risk)
5. Swamp (last resort - very dangerous)

Never drink:
- Water with dead animals nearby
- Water with chemical smell
- Water with rainbow sheen (oil)
- Water with foam (detergent)

WATER FROM PLANTS - EMERGENCY METHODS

VINE WATER (HIGH YIELD):
1. Find thick vine (thumb-sized or larger)
2. Cut high first, as high as you can reach
3. Cut low second, 12 inches from ground
4. Let water drip into mouth/container
5. Test first drop on skin - if no irritation, safe

GOOD VINES:
- Grape vines (excellent)
- Rattan (tropical)
- Any vine that drips clear, odorless water

BAD VINES:
- Milky sap = POISON
- Colored sap = POISON
- Bitter taste = POISON

BAMBOO WATER:
- Shake green bamboo - hear water sloshing?
- Cut notch at base of section
- Water inside is sterile and safe
- Old yellow bamboo = no water

BARREL CACTUS (Desert Emergency):
1. Cut off top third
2. Mash pulp inside
3. Let juice accumulate (2-3 hours)
4. Strain through cloth
5. Yields 1-2 liters
WARNING: Can cause diarrhea. Use only in dire emergency.

PRICKLY PEAR CACTUS:
- Pads contain moisture
- Peel off spines carefully
- Cut open and suck pulp
- Not true water but helps with hydration

COCONUTS (Tropical):
- Green coconuts have most water (1-2 cups)
- Brown coconuts have less liquid
- Coconut water is sterile inside
- Excellent electrolyte balance

TREE WATER (Morning Collection):
1. Tie plastic bag around leafy branch
2. Place small stone in bag to create low point
3. Seal bag around branch
4. Transpiration creates water in bag
5. Collect in evening
6. Can yield 50-100ml per bag

BIRCH/MAPLE SAP (Spring):
- Tap tree like for syrup
- Drill small hole or cut V-notch
- Insert tube/spout
- Collect dripping sap
- Safe to drink raw
- Slight sweet taste
- Available early spring only

BANANA/PLANTAIN PLANTS:
- Cut plant down 3 inches from ground
- Hollow out center stump
- Water will seep and collect in hollow
- Can refill 3-4 times
- Yields 1-2 liters per day

WATER VINES (Tropical):
Look for vines on trees. Cut high, then low.
Good indicators:
- Rough bark
- Clear, odorless liquid
- No milky appearance

RAIN COLLECTION:
- Large leaves funnel into container
- Tarp/plastic = best collector
- Dig hole, line with plastic
- 1 inch of rain = substantial water

NEVER DRINK:
- Milky plant fluids
- Colored plant fluids
- Bitter-tasting liquids
- Sap that irritates skin

WATER FROM ICE AND SNOW - COLD WEATHER

CRITICAL WARNING:
Never eat snow/ice directly!
- Lowers core body temperature
- Causes dehydration (body uses water to melt it)
- Can cause hypothermia
- Wastes precious calories

MELTING SNOW FOR WATER:

EFFICIENCY TIPS:
- Start with small amount in pot
- Add snow gradually as it melts
- Takes 10 parts snow = 1 part water
- Packed snow yields more than powder

HEAT SOURCES:
1. Fire (most efficient)
2. Body heat (emergency only - wastes calories)
3. Sunlight (black container in sun)

COLOR SELECTION:
WHITE SNOW: Always safe when melted
PINK/RED SNOW: Algae - safe but tastes bad
YELLOW SNOW: Never use (urine/contaminated)
BLUE ICE: Old glacier ice - safe, most water per volume

ICE VS SNOW:
ICE is better:
- Less volume needed (already compressed)
- Melts to more water per weight
- Takes less fuel to melt
- Clear ice = purest water

SEA ICE (Coastal):
OLD SEA ICE (Blue/black, rounded):
- Most salt has leached out
- Safe to melt and drink
- Tastes slightly brackish but usable

NEW SEA ICE (White, sharp):
- Still very salty
- Do NOT drink
- Can cause dehydration and kidney failure

TEST: Taste tiny bit. If salty, don't use.

EFFICIENT MELTING METHOD:
1. Fill pot 1/4 with water (from previous melt)
2. Add snow/ice gradually
3. Keep adding as it melts
4. Never burn dry - wastes fuel and damages pot

SOLAR MELTING:
- Dark colored bag with snow
- Leave in sun
- Insulate with clothing
- Slow but saves fuel
- Can yield 1-2 liters per day

BODY HEAT MELTING (Emergency Only):
- Put snow in water bottle
- Keep bottle inside coat
- Your body heat melts it
- ONLY if you have calories to spare
- ONLY if desperate

DAILY WATER NEEDS IN COLD:
- Still need 3-5 liters per day
- Cold air is dry - dehydrates fast
- Breathing cold air uses moisture
- Easy to forget to drink when cold
- FORCE yourself to drink

WARNING SIGNS OF DEHYDRATION IN COLD:
- Dark yellow urine
- Reduced urination
- Headache
- Fatigue (different from cold fatigue)
- Dizziness

ALTITUDE + COLD:
- Need even MORE water at altitude
- 4-6 liters per day above 10,000 feet
- Altitude sickness worsens with dehydration

create_file(f'{base}/survival/shelter/01_shelter_priorities.txt', """
SHELTER - YOUR FIRST PRIORITY

WHEN SHELTER COMES BEFORE WATER:
- Temperature below 50°F (10°C) and wet
- Temperature below 32°F (0°C)
- Temperature above 95°F (35°C) in desert
- High winds (windchill can kill in hours)
- Heavy rain/snow

HYPOTHERMIA can kill in 3 hours.
EXPOSURE can kill faster than dehydration.

SHELTER LOCATION - CRITICAL FACTORS:

AVOID:
- Valley bottoms (cold air sinks, frost pockets)
- Exposed ridges (wind, lightning)
- Under dead trees (widowmakers)
- Dry creek beds (flash floods)
- Game trails (animal traffic)
- Avalanche zones (steep slopes with recent snow)

LOOK FOR:
- Natural windbreaks (rock walls, dense trees)
- High enough to avoid cold air drainage
- Low enough to avoid wind exposure
- Near water (but not too close - insects, animals)
- Dry ground (critical!)
- South-facing slope (Northern hemisphere - more sun)
- North-facing slope (Southern hemisphere)
- Natural materials for building

GROUND INSULATION:
Your body loses heat 25 times faster on cold ground than in cold air.

MINIMUM INSULATION:
- 6 inches of dry leaves, grass, or pine needles
- OR sleeping mat
- OR layer of bark/wood
- Never sleep directly on ground in cold weather

EMERGENCY INSULATION:
- Stuff clothing with dry leaves/grass
- Newspaper (excellent insulator)
- Bark pieces
- Dry moss
- Pine boughs

WIND PROTECTION:
Wind speed of 10 mph can make 40°F feel like 32°F
Wind speed of 20 mph can make 40°F feel like 25°F

ALWAYS build shelter with back to prevailing wind

DEBRIS HUT - BEST SOLO SURVIVAL SHELTER

WHY IT'S BEST:
- Built from natural materials only
- Excellent insulation
- Waterproof when built right
- Retains body heat
- No tools required (better with knife)

LOCATION:
- Two trees 6-8 feet apart, OR
- One fallen tree, OR
- Large rock for ridgepole support

CONSTRUCTION STEPS:

STEP 1 - RIDGEPOLE:
- Strong branch 9-12 feet long
- 3-4 inches diameter
- Lean at 45° angle between supports
- Height at entrance: 3 feet (just enough to crawl in)
- Low = better heat retention

STEP 2 - RIBBING:
- Branches 6-8 feet long
- Lean against ridgepole on both sides
- Space 6 inches apart
- Angle: 45-50 degrees
- Create A-frame shape
- Extend 2-3 feet beyond foot of shelter (wind protection)

STEP 3 - LATTICE:
- Small sticks perpendicular to ribs
- Weave if possible
- Creates mesh to hold debris
- Prevents debris from falling through

STEP 4 - DEBRIS LAYER 1 (Waterproofing):
- Large leaves (best)
- Bark slabs
- Grass bundles
- Layer like shingles, bottom to top
- Each layer overlaps 50%
- Completely cover framework

STEP 5 - DEBRIS LAYER 2 (Insulation):
- Pile leaves, pine needles, grass
- MINIMUM 2 feet thick all around
- 3 feet thick = much better
- More = warmer
- Can't be too thick!

STEP 6 - FINAL LAYER (Structure):
- Branches over debris
- Prevents wind from blowing debris away
- Small logs work well

STEP 7 - DOOR PLUG:
- Bundle of debris/leaves
- Must completely seal entrance
- Critical for heat retention!
- Pull in after you enter

INTERIOR:
- Fill floor with 12+ inches of dry leaves/grass
- Fluff it up
- You'll compress it when you lie down
- Restock each evening

SIZE:
Make it SMALL!
- Just big enough to lie down
- Your body heat warms the space
- Bigger = colder
- Should feel cramped

COMPLETED HUT WILL:
- Look like a giant pile of leaves
- Be waterproof in heavy rain
- Keep you warm in freezing temps
- Retain heat from body only (no fire needed)

TESTING:
- Lie inside
- Pull door plug closed
- Within 30 minutes should feel warm
- If not, add more debris layers

ADVANCED:
- Dig shallow pit in floor (cold air sinks)
- Line pit with hot rocks before bed
- Cover rocks with dirt, then bedding

SPRING/SUMMER VERSION:
- Less debris (1 foot layer)
- Better ventilation
- Focus on waterproofing, not insulation

TIME TO BUILD:
- First time: 4-6 hours
- With practice: 2-3 hours
- Worth every minute when temperature drops!

LEAN-TO SHELTER - QUICK BUILD

BEST FOR:
- Short-term shelter (1-3 days)
- Mild weather
- When you have fire for heat
- Wind protection with fire

NOT GOOD FOR:
- Cold weather without fire
- Heavy rain (unless well-built)
- Retaining heat (one side open)

CONSTRUCTION:

STEP 1 - LOCATION:
- Find two trees 6-8 feet apart
- OR one long fallen tree
- Natural wind break behind

STEP 2 - RIDGEPOLE:
- Strong branch 8-10 feet long
- Lash between trees at 4-5 feet high
- OR lean against single support

STEP 3 - RIBBING:
- Branches 6-8 feet long
- Lean against ridgepole at 45° angle
- Space 4-6 inches apart
- All on same side (back to wind)

STEP 4 - THATCHING:
BOTTOM TO TOP (like roof shingles):

Layer 1 (Bottom):
- Long grass bundles OR
- Pine boughs OR
- Large leaves
- Tie/weave to ribs

Layer 2:
- Overlap Layer 1 by 50%
- Continue to top

Continue layers until top of ridge

THICKNESS:
- Minimum 6 inches of material
- 12 inches = much better waterproofing

STEP 5 - BACK WALL:
- Build wall of stacked branches behind ridgepole
- Weave smaller branches through
- Add debris/leaves
- Blocks wind from behind

STEP 6 - FIRE REFLECTOR:
CRITICAL for warmth!

Build wall 4-6 feet in front of shelter:
- Stack logs or rocks 3-4 feet high
- 6-8 feet wide
- Angled slightly toward shelter

Build fire between shelter and reflector

FIRE REFLECTS HEAT INTO SHELTER!

STEP 7 - BEDDING:
- 6-12 inches of dry leaves/grass
- Raises you off cold ground
- Fluff before sleeping

ADVANCED LEAN-TO:

DOUBLE LEAN-TO:
- Two lean-tos facing each other
- Fire in middle
- Excellent heat retention
- Good for 2-3 people

STONE BACKING:
- Build lean-to in front of rock wall
- Rock reflects heat
- Retains warmth after fire dies

PITCHED ROOF:
- Add side walls
- Creates full triangle
- Much better rain protection
- Closer to debris hut design

WITH TARP:
- Drape tarp over ridgepole
- Stake bottom to ground
- STILL add natural materials (insulation + camouflage)
- Tarp alone = cold at night

TIME TO BUILD:
- Basic: 1-2 hours
- Waterproof: 3-4 hours
- With fire reflector: Add 1 hour

FIRE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep fire small and constant
- Large fire = too hot, wastes wood
- Goal: steady heat all night
- Collect 3x more wood than you think you need
- Hardwood burns longer
- Softwood starts easier

SNOW SHELTERS - COLD WEATHER SURVIVAL

QUINZHEE (Snow Cave) - BEST WINTER SHELTER

ADVANTAGES:
- Warmer than debris hut in deep snow
- Interior can be 40°F warmer than outside
- Windproof
- Quiet
- Uses abundant material (snow)

LOCATION:
- Flat area or slight depression
- Deep snow (4+ feet)
- Away from avalanche danger
- Not under snow-loaded trees

CONSTRUCTION:

STEP 1 - PILE SNOW:
- Shovel/push snow into pile
- 8-10 feet diameter
- 6-7 feet high
- Let consolidate 1-2 hours (critical!)
- Snow bonds and strengthens

STEP 2 - INSERT STICKS:
- Push 12-inch sticks into pile
- All around, pointing to center
- These are your thickness guides
- When you hit stick tip = stop digging

STEP 3 - DIG ENTRANCE:
- Start on downwind side
- Dig tunnel at upward angle
- Tunnel: 2-3 feet long
- Keep entrance small (conserves heat)

STEP 4 - HOLLOW OUT INTERIOR:
- Reach in and dig upward
- Create dome shape
- Stop when you hit stick tips
- Walls should be 12 inches thick minimum
- Dome shape = strongest

STEP 5 - SLEEPING PLATFORM:
- Make elevated bench inside
- 18-24 inches above entrance
- Cold air sinks to entrance
- You sleep warm above it

STEP 6 - VENTILATION (CRITICAL!):
- Poke fist-sized hole in roof
- Essential for air exchange
- Carbon dioxide sinks, fresh air enters
- Check vent hole regularly
- Can be blocked by snow

STEP 7 - DOOR PLUG:
- Block entrance with pack or snow block
- Leave small gap at bottom (air intake)

INTERIOR TIPS:
- Smooth ceiling (prevents drips)
- Can carve shelves in walls
- Candle provides light + small heat
- Sleep with head toward entrance

TIME TO BUILD: 3-4 hours

WARNING SIGNS:
- Headache = poor ventilation (CO2 buildup)
- Difficulty breathing = check vent!
- Dripping ceiling = too warm, open door

TEMPERATURE:
- Outside: -20°F
- Inside: +20°F to +32°F
- Your body heat warms it!

SNOW TRENCH - EMERGENCY FAST SHELTER

FOR: Quick emergency shelter in deep snow

CONSTRUCTION:
1. Dig trench: 7 feet long, 3 feet wide, 3 feet deep
2. Lay branches/skis across top
3. Cover with tarp/poncho
4. Pile 12+ inches snow on top
5. Block ends with snow/packs
6. Insulate floor with pine boughs

TIME: 30-60 minutes

EFFECTIVE to -10°F with good insulation

---

TREE WELL SHELTER - EMERGENCY

WARNING: Risk of tree well suffocation - use only if necessary

LOCATION:
- Base of large evergreen tree
- Natural snow-free depression
- Branches overhead for roof

CONSTRUCTION:
1. Dig deeper into well
2. Add floor insulation (boughs)
3. Use fallen branches to create roof frame
4. Cover with snow blocks
5. Leave vent hole

Better than nothing, but less safe than quinzhee

---

IGLOO - BEST BUT REQUIRES SKILL

Requires:
- Right snow consistency (packable, not powder)
- Snow saw or knife
- Experience (practice first!)

Brief steps:
1. Cut snow blocks (18"x12"x6")
2. Arrange in circle, spiral upward
3. Tilt blocks inward
4. Create dome
5. Add entrance tunnel
6. Vent hole at top

Takes practice but BEST cold weather shelter
Can be 60°F warmer inside than outside

PRACTICE IN NON-EMERGENCY FIRST!

---

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- Always ventilate snow shelters
- Sleep with head toward door
- Keep shovel inside (in case buried)
- Mark shelter entrance with stick/pole
- Check vent hole before sleeping
- Never use fire inside snow shelter (melting!)

FIRE FUNDAMENTALS - LIFE-SAVING HEAT

FIRE PROVIDES:
- Warmth (prevents hypothermia)
- Water purification (boiling)
- Signaling (rescue)
- Morale (psychological survival)
- Cooking (nutrition)
- Predator deterrent
- Light (navigation, tasks)

FIRE TRIANGLE - ALL THREE REQUIRED:
1. HEAT (ignition source)
2. FUEL (wood, grass)
3. OXYGEN (air flow)

Remove any one = fire dies

---

FUEL STAGES - CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND

STAGE 1: TINDER
- Ignites from single spark or ember
- Burns hot and fast (1-2 minutes)
- Size: Thread to pencil lead

BEST NATURAL TINDER:
- Birch bark (peels off tree, burns even wet!)
- Cedar bark (shred into fibers)
- Dry pine needles
- Dry grass (handful, fluffed)
- Cattail fluff
- Thistle down
- Crushed dry leaves

BEST PROCESSED TINDER:
- Char cloth (cotton burned in tin)
- Vaseline cotton balls (waterproof fire starter)
- Dryer lint
- Shredded paper
- Steel wool (with battery)

MAKING TINDER WHEN EVERYTHING IS WET:
- Scrape inner bark from dead branches
- Feather sticks (explained below)
- Resin from pine trees (highly flammable!)
- Standing dead wood (center is dry)

---

STAGE 2: KINDLING
- Catches from burning tinder
- Burns 5-15 minutes
- Size: Pencil to finger thickness

BEST KINDLING:
- Small dead twigs (still on tree = dry)
- Split pieces of larger wood
- Fatwood (resinous pine)
- Dry conifer branches

CRITICAL: Snap test
- Dead branch should SNAP cleanly
- If it bends = too wet
- Collect from off the ground when possible

---

STAGE 3: FUEL WOOD
- Sustains fire for hours
- Size: Finger to wrist thickness for 1-4 hour fires
- Size: Arm thickness for overnight fires

HARDWOOD vs SOFTWOOD:

HARDWOOD (Best for heat):
- Oak, maple, ash, hickory
- Burns hot and long
- Produces coals
- Better for cooking
- Harder to ignite

SOFTWOOD (Best for starting):
- Pine, fir, spruce, cedar
- Ignites easily
- Burns fast and hot
- More smoke
- Less coals
- Good for getting hardwood started

DEAD vs GREEN:

DEAD WOOD:
- Gray color
- Bark falling off
- Lighter weight
- Snaps easily
- Burns well

GREEN WOOD:
- Tight bark
- Heavier
- Bends before breaking
- Smokes heavily
- Won't sustain fire
- DON'T WASTE TIME - only use dead wood

---

FINDING DRY WOOD IN RAIN:

1. STANDING DEAD TREES:
- Look for trees with no bark
- No leaves/needles
- Split wood - center is dry!

2. UNDERSIDE OF FALLEN LOGS:
- Bottom is protected from rain
- Peel bark, scrape surface
- Inner wood is dry

3. LOW BRANCHES ON EVERGREENS:
- Protected by canopy above
- Dead branches still on tree
- Snap off at trunk

4. INSIDE THICK BARK:
- Split apart
- Core stays dry even in rain

5. TREE RESIN/SAP:
- Sticky, highly flammable
- Burns even when wet
- Look for "pitch wood" or "fatwood"
- Found in pine stumps/knots

---

FEATHER STICKS - CRITICAL WET WEATHER SKILL

WHAT: Wood shaved into thin curls, still attached

HOW TO MAKE:
1. Find dry stick (wrist thickness)
2. Shave thin curls down stick with knife
3. Don't cut curls off - leave attached
4. Create many thin shavings
5. Stand stick up, light curls at bottom

WHY IT WORKS:
- Thin shavings ignite easily
- Many surfaces for fire to catch
- Solid wood provides sustained burn
- Transitions from tinder to kindling

PRACTICE THIS SKILL!

FIRE PLACEMENT TIPS:

DISTANCE FROM SHELTER:
- 6-10 feet (not too close!)
- Enough to prevent sparks hitting shelter
- Close enough for heat

WIND DIRECTION:
- Consider smoke direction
- Don't smoke yourself out
- Use for insect control (upwind of bugs)

REFLECTORS:
- Rock wall or log wall behind fire
- 3-4 feet high
- Reflects heat toward you
- Can double warmth!

ROCK RING:
- Doesn't contain fire better (myth)
- Does prevent spread on dry ground
- Holds coals in organized area
- Provides mental boundary

FIRE IGNITION METHODS - CREATING HEAT

METHOD 1: FRICTION FIRES - NO TOOLS

BOW DRILL - MOST RELIABLE FRICTION METHOD

PARTS NEEDED:
1. Fireboard (baseboard)
2. Spindle (drill)
3. Bow
4. Handhold (top piece)
5. Cordage

MATERIALS:
- Wood should be dry, medium-soft
- Same wood species for spindle and fireboard
- Good woods: Cottonwood, willow, cedar, cypress, elm

FIREBOARD:
- 12-18 inches long
- 2-3 inches wide
- 3/4 inch thick
- Flat on both sides

SPINDLE:
- 8-10 inches long
- 3/4 inch diameter
- Straight
- Round
- Pointed at top, blunt at bottom

BOW:
- Slightly curved branch
- 2 feet long
- Strong (won't break)
- String with cordage

HANDHOLD:
- Piece of hard wood or rock
- Socket/depression for spindle top
- Can lubricate with pine sap or skin oil

CONSTRUCTION STEPS:

1. CUT NOTCH IN FIREBOARD:
- Burn starter depression with spindle
- Cut V-notch to center of depression (like pizza slice)
- Notch should be 1/8 of circle
- Coal will form at point of V

2. PREPARE TINDER NEST:
- Use finest, driest material
- Nest shape
- Loosely packed

3. TECHNIQUE:
- Kneel on right knee (right-handed)
- Left foot on fireboard
- Wrap bow string once around spindle
- Place spindle in depression
- Handhold on top of spindle
- Start slow - create friction groove
- Speed up - long, fast strokes
- Press down firmly
- Continue until smoking heavily
- Black powder accumulates in notch
- Keep going - will glow red (ember)

4. EMBER TO FLAME:
- Carefully transfer ember to tinder nest
- Gently blow/wave
- Tinder will smoke, then ignite
- Add to kindling structure

CRITICAL TIPS:
- 80% of failures = poor materials
- Wood must be DRY
- Consistent speed and pressure
- Don't give up - takes practice
- First time may take 1 hour
- With practice: 5-10 minutes

---

HAND DRILL - HARDER THAN BOW DRILL

MATERIALS:
- Spindle: 18-24 inches long, 1/4 inch diameter
- Fireboard: Same as bow drill

TECHNIQUE:
1. Place spindle in fireboard depression
2. Roll spindle between palms
3. Press downward as you roll
4. Hands move down spindle
5. Quickly return to top and repeat
6. Very physically demanding

EASIER WITH:
- Two people alternating
- Dry conditions
- Softer woods
- Experience

---

FIRE PLOUGH - ALTERNATIVE FRICTION

MATERIALS:
- Softwood board with groove
- Hardwood stick to plough with

TECHNIQUE:
1. Cut groove in board
2. Rub stick up and down groove rapidly
3. Friction creates dust
4. Dust accumulates and ignites

EASIER in dry climates
HARDER than bow drill

---

METHOD 2: FLINT AND STEEL

MATERIALS:
- Flint (or other hard rock: quartz, obsidian)
- Steel (knife back, steel striker)
- Char cloth (easiest to catch spark)

TECHNIQUE:
1. Hold flint in one hand
2. Place char cloth on flint
3. Strike down edge of flint with steel
4. Sparks land on char cloth
5. Char cloth glows red
6. Transfer to tinder nest
7. Blow gently to flame

ADVANTAGES:
- Works when wet (dry flint and steel first)
- Reliable
- Fast with practice

MAKING CHAR CLOTH:
1. Cut 100% cotton into 2-inch squares
2. Place in metal tin with small hole in lid
3. Put tin in fire
4. Smoke will pour out hole
5. When smoke stops = done
6. Let cool completely before opening
7. Black cloth = char cloth

---

METHOD 3: FERROCERIUM ROD (Survival Tool)

MODERN EQUIVALENT to flint & steel

TECHNIQUE:
1. Place rod near tinder
2. Scrape down rod with steel (knife back)
3. Hot sparks (3000°F) ignite tinder
4. Much easier than flint & steel

WORKS WHEN WET!
Can strike thousands of times

---

METHOD 4: MAGNIFYING GLASS/LENS

REQUIREMENTS:
- Bright sun
- Lens (magnifying glass, eyeglasses, camera lens)
- Tinder

TECHNIQUE:
1. Hold lens over tinder
2. Focus sun into smallest point
3. Hold steady
4. Tinder will smoke and glow
5. Blow gently to flame

ALTERNATIVES:
- Bottom of clear water bottle (fill with water = lens)
- Ice lens (shape clear ice into lens)
- Condom/balloon filled with water

ONLY WORKS IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT

---

METHOD 5: BATTERY AND STEEL WOOL

MATERIALS:
- 9V battery OR any battery
- Steel wool (0000 grade best)

TECHNIQUE:
1. Stretch steel wool slightly
2. Touch both battery terminals to wool
3. Wool ignites instantly
4. Place in tinder nest quickly

ALSO WORKS:
- Car battery + jumper cables touching
- Flashlight batteries in series + gum wrapper

---

METHOD 6: FIRE PISTON - COMPRESSION IGNITION

Advanced tool - creates heat through rapid air compression

If you have one:
1. Place char cloth in cylinder
2. Rapidly slam piston down
3. Compression creates heat
4. Char cloth ignites

Expensive but reliable

---

EMERGENCY IGNITION SOURCES:

- Cigarette lighter (best - always carry!)
- Waterproof matches (always carry!)
- Road flare
- Ammunition (remove bullet, use powder)
- Camera flash (with steel wool)

---

PRACTICE HIERARCHY:

EASIEST TO HARDEST:
1. Lighter/matches (modern)
2. Ferrocerium rod
3. Flint and steel with char cloth
4. Magnifying glass (sunny day)
5. Battery and steel wool
6. Bow drill
7. Hand drill
8. Fire plough
