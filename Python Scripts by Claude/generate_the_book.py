A - Airway: Ensure breathing passage
B - Breathing: Check for respiration
C - Circulation: Check pulse, stop
    bleeding

SEVERE BLEEDING:
1. Apply direct pressure with cloth
2. Elevate wound above heart
3. Don't remove embedded objects
4. Apply pressure to pressure points
5. Use tourniquet only if life-
   threatening

CHOKING (Heimlich Maneuver):
1. Stand behind person
2. Fist above navel, below ribs
3. Grasp fist with other hand
4. Quick upward thrusts
5. Repeat until object dislodged

BURNS:
1st degree: Cool water, aloe
2nd degree: Cool water, cover,
  don't pop blisters
3rd degree: Call 911, cover loosely,
  don't remove clothing

CPR:
1. Check responsiveness
2. Call 911
3. 30 chest compressions (2 inches)
4. 2 rescue breaths
5. Repeat until help arrives
Rate: 100-120 compressions/min

SHOCK:
Signs: Pale, rapid pulse, confusion
Treatment: Lay flat, elevate legs,
  keep warm, don't give food/water

SNAKE BITE:
- Keep calm, immobilize limb
- Remove jewelry/tight clothing
- Keep bite below heart
- DO NOT: cut, suck, ice, tourniquet
- Seek medical help immediately

FRACTURES:
- Don't move unless necessary
- Immobilize joint above and below
- Apply ice wrapped in cloth

Methods to make water safe for
drinking in survival situations.

BOILING (Most Reliable):
1. Bring to rolling boil
2. Boil for 1 minute (3 min at
   high altitude)
3. Let cool before drinking
Kills: All pathogens

CHEMICAL TREATMENT:
Iodine Tablets:
- 2 tablets per liter
- Wait 30 minutes
- Neutralize with Vitamin C

Bleach (unscented):
- 2 drops per liter (clear water)
- 4 drops per liter (cloudy water)
- Wait 30 minutes
- Should smell slightly of chlorine

FILTRATION:
Commercial filter: Follow instructions
DIY filter layers (top to bottom):
1. Cloth
2. Charcoal
3. Sand
4. Gravel
5. Pebbles
Note: Still boil after filtering

SOLAR DISINFECTION (SODIS):
1. Clear plastic bottle
2. Fill with water
3. Place in direct sun 6 hours
   (2 days if cloudy)
Works: UV kills pathogens

SIGNS OF CONTAMINATION:
- Cloudy appearance
- Bad smell
- Dead animals nearby
- Stagnant water
- Downstream from human activity

WATER SOURCES (Best to Worst):
1. Rain water
2. Running streams/rivers
3. Springs
4. Lakes/ponds
5. Swamps/stagnant water

ALWAYS purify unless certain safe!

Essential techniques for starting
fire in various conditions.

FIRE TRIANGLE (All Required):
1. Heat (spark/friction)
2. Fuel (wood/tinder)
3. Oxygen (air flow)

TINDER (catches spark):
- Dry grass, leaves
- Bark (birch, cedar)
- Cotton balls
- Dryer lint
- Char cloth
- Fine wood shavings

KINDLING (small sticks):
- Pencil-thick dry twigs
- Small dry branches
- Pine needles
- Split softwood

FUEL (sustains fire):
- Finger-thick branches
- Arm-thick logs
- Hardwood for long burning

FRICTION METHODS:
Bow Drill:
1. Spindle in board notch
2. Bow wrapped around spindle
3. Pressure with hand piece
4. Rapid back-forth motion
5. Ember forms in notch

Hand Drill:
1. Vertical spindle in board
2. Roll rapidly between palms
3. Downward pressure
4. Very difficult, requires practice

MODERN METHODS:
Matches: Keep dry, waterproof
Lighter: Most reliable
Ferro rod: Works when wet
Magnifying glass: Needs sun

FIRE LAY STRUCTURES:
Teepee: Quick, hot fire
Log cabin: Long-lasting
Lean-to: Wind protection
Dakota hole: Concealed, efficient

SAFETY:
- Clear area around fire
- Keep water nearby
- Never leave unattended
- Fully extinguish before leaving
- Check local fire regulations

Basic shelter construction for
protection from elements.

PRIORITIES:
1. Location (dry, level, protected)
2. Insulation from ground
3. Protection from wind/rain
4. Ventilation

LEAN-TO SHELTER:
Materials: Branches, leaves/bark
1. Find or make ridgepole between
   two trees (6ft high)
2. Lean branches against ridgepole
   at 45¬∞ angle
3. Cover with leaves, bark, debris
4. Make thick (12+ inches)
5. Create bed of leaves inside

A-FRAME SHELTER:
1. Ridge pole between two supports
2. Lean branches on both sides
3. Cover both sides with debris
4. Smaller, better insulated

DEBRIS HUT (Best Insulation):
1. Ridge pole from tree to ground
2. Rib branches along both sides
3. Pile debris 3+ feet thick
4. Small entrance, barely fit inside
5. Very warm, weatherproof

EMERGENCY SHELTERS:
Snow cave: Dig into snow bank,
  small entrance, vent hole
Tarp: Versatile, many configurations
Natural: Rock overhangs, fallen logs

BEDDING:
- Never sleep directly on ground
- 6+ inches of leaves/pine needles
- Keeps you insulated from cold

LOCATION TIPS:
Avoid: Valley bottoms (cold air)
       Hilltops (wind)
       Under dead trees
       Dry riverbeds
Choose: Slightly elevated
        Natural windbreak
        Near resources (water, wood)

Shelter before fire before water

dehydration!
