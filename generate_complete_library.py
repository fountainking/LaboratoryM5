- Less tannin = less processing
- Sweet when processed

RED OAKS (More bitter):
- Red oak, Black oak, Pin oak
- Pointed leaf lobes with bristles

8. Taste test - should be sweet

NOTE: Hot water method removes some oils
Cold method preserves more nutrition

PREPARATION:

SHELLING:

CONFUSION RISK - DANGEROUS LOOK-ALIKES:

LOOKS LIKE WILD ONION (Edible):
DIFFERENCES:
- Death camas: NO onion smell
- Wild onion: strong onion smell when crushed
- ALWAYS SMELL TEST!

LOOKS LIKE WILD GARLIC (Edible):
DIFFERENCES:
- Death camas: NO garlic smell
- Wild garlic: obvious garlic smell
- ALWAYS SMELL TEST!

LOOKS LIKE CAMAS LILY (Edible):
DIFFERENCES:
- Death camas: white/cream flowers
- Edible camas: blue/purple flowers
- Death camas: usually blooms earlier
- NEVER eat if flowers are white!
- ONLY harvest camas when in blue bloom!

IDENTIFICATION RULES:

NEVER EAT if:
- No onion/garlic smell
- White or cream flowers
- Any doubt whatsoever

ONLY EAT if:
- Strong onion/garlic smell AND
- You're 100% certain it's not death camas

FIRST AID (IF INGESTED):
1. Call poison control IMMEDIATELY
  (1-800-222-1222 in US)
2. Do NOT induce vomiting
3. Give activated charcoal if available
4. Keep victim calm and still
5. Monitor breathing
6. Seek emergency medical help
7. Bring plant sample if possible

MEDICAL TREATMENT:
- Gastric lavage (stomach pump)
- Activated charcoal
- IV fluids
- Atropine for heart issues
- Supportive care
- Hospitalization required

PREVENTION:
- Learn to identify positively
- Never eat white-flowered bulbs
- Always smell test bulbs (onion/garlic)
- When in doubt, DON'T
- Teach children to avoid
- Never assume "it looks like onion"

HISTORICAL POISONINGS:
- Native Americans knew to avoid
- Settlers/explorers died from confusion
- Livestock poisoning common
- Still causes deaths today

RANGE:
- Western US and Canada (abundant)
- Some eastern species
- Plains and mountain states
- California to Montana
- Can appear in lawns/fields

SURVIVAL LESSON:
Positive identification = life or death
NEVER take chances with bulb plants
ONE mistake = fatal
Learn the difference BEFORE foraging

REMEMBER:
IF IT DOESN'T SMELL LIKE ONION/GARLIC = DON'T EAT IT!

This plant has killed experienced foragers
Respect its danger
