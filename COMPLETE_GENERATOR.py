    "Death_Camas": """DEATH CAMAS - DEADLY POISON

Zigadenus / Toxicoscordion species

DANGER LEVEL: EXTREME - FATAL
Can kill within hours!

IDENTIFICATION:
Grass-like leaves (look like onion/garlic)
White or cream colored flowers (6 petals each)
Flowers in elongated cluster on stalk
Grows from bulb underground
Height: 1-2 feet
Blooms: Spring to early summer

HABITAT:
Meadows, grasslands, open areas
Mountain slopes, foothills
Open woodlands
Western North America (most common)
Some species in eastern US

TOXIC COMPOUNDS:
Alkaloid toxins (zygacine, zygadenine)
ALL PARTS EXTREMELY POISONOUS
Bulb most toxic
Flowers and leaves also deadly
No known antidote!

LETHAL DOSE:
Very small amount can kill
Children especially vulnerable
Livestock frequently poisoned
Multiple human fatalities recorded

SYMPTOMS (Onset 30 min - 2 hours):

EARLY SIGNS:
Burning sensation in mouth and throat
Excessive salivation, drooling
Severe nausea
Violent vomiting
Abdominal cramping and pain
Diarrhea

PROGRESSING:
Severe headache
Dizziness, vertigo
Blurred or double vision
Excessive sweating
Muscular weakness
Difficulty swallowing

SEVERE (Life-threatening):
Difficulty breathing
Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
Dangerously low blood pressure
Loss of coordination
Tremors and seizures
Coma
DEATH from respiratory failure

DEATH TIMELINE:
Can occur within 8-24 hours if untreated
Rapid treatment essential
Fatality rate HIGH without medical care

DANGEROUS LOOK-ALIKES:

WILD ONION/GARLIC (Edible):
KEY DIFFERENCE: SMELL!
- Death camas: NO onion smell
- Wild onion: STRONG onion smell when crushed

ALWAYS CRUSH AND SMELL!
If no onion/garlic smell = DON'T EAT!

EDIBLE CAMAS (Camassia):
CRITICAL DIFFERENCES:
- Death camas: WHITE or CREAM flowers
- Edible camas: BLUE or PURPLE flowers
- Death camas: Often blooms earlier

NEVER harvest camas when flowers are white!
ONLY harvest when blue/purple flowers present!
They often grow in same areas!

CONFUSION RISK:
Before flowering: Nearly impossible to tell apart
After flowers wither: Very difficult
ONLY harvest camas in full blue bloom!

IDENTIFICATION RULES:

NEVER EAT IF:
- White or cream flowers
- No onion/garlic smell
- ANY doubt whatsoever
- Not in full bloom (for camas)

ONLY SAFE IF:
- STRONG onion/garlic smell AND
- 100% certain it's not death camas

ONE MISTAKE = POTENTIAL DEATH!

FIRST AID IF INGESTED:

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Call 911 immediately
2. Call Poison Control: 1-800-222-1222 (US)
3. DO NOT induce vomiting
4. Give activated charcoal if available (20-30g)
5. Keep victim calm, lying down
6. Monitor breathing constantly
7. Be prepared for CPR
8. Bring plant sample to hospital (if possible)

DO NOT WAIT for symptoms!
If ingested, get emergency help NOW!

MEDICAL TREATMENT:
Hospital gastric lavage (stomach pump)
Activated charcoal administration
IV fluids for hydration
Atropine for heart rhythm problems
Respiratory support if needed
Close monitoring 24-48 hours
Intensive care may be required

PREVENTION:

EDUCATION:
Learn positive identification
Teach children to never eat white-flowered bulbs
Know the difference before foraging
Practice identification when not hungry

FORAGING RULES:
Always smell test bulbs
Never assume "looks like onion"
When in doubt, throw it out!
Have expert verify if learning

FIELD SAFETY:
Never eat unidentified plants
Double-check all bulb plants
Avoid white-flowered bulbs entirely
Only harvest what you're 100% certain of

HISTORICAL POISONINGS:

NATIVE AMERICANS:
Knew to avoid completely
Warned settlers of danger
Used different areas for edible camas

SETTLERS & EXPLORERS:
Many deaths from confusion with edible plants
Lewis & Clark expedition members poisoned (survived)
Documented throughout western settlement

LIVESTOCK:
Frequent cause of cattle/sheep poisoning
Sheep especially susceptible
Ranchers know to avoid

MODERN CASES:
Still causes poisonings today
Confusion with wild onion/garlic
Confusion with edible camas
Several deaths per decade in US

RANGE & DISTRIBUTION:

WESTERN US & CANADA:
Most common in western states
Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, Washington
California mountains
British Columbia
Plains states to Pacific

HABITAT:
Often in same meadows as edible camas!
Can be mixed in with edible plants
Requires extra caution

SURVIVAL LESSON:

POSITIVE ID = LIFE OR DEATH:
This plant proves why plant ID is critical
One mistake is fatal
No room for "pretty sure"
Expert knowledge required for bulb foraging

NEVER TAKE CHANCES:
If it doesn't smell like onion/garlic = DON'T EAT
White flowers on bulb plant = AVOID
Any doubt = Don't risk it

TEACH OTHERS:
Show family, especially children
They need to recognize danger
Keep children from eating wild plants
Supervision in wild areas

RESPECT NATURE:
Beautiful plants can be deadly
Pretty flowers don't mean safe
Nature doesn't care about our mistakes
Knowledge is survival

REMEMBER THIS RULE:
"If it doesn't smell like onion or garlic,
it might be death camas - leave it alone!"

This plant has killed experienced foragers.
It kills livestock regularly.
It looks harmless.
It looks like food.
It is DEADLY.

Your life depends on proper identification.
When in doubt, go without!
